00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.520
Luigi Iannone: Hello!

2
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.970
Luigi Iannone: We will wait a few minutes for people to join in before starting. Okay.

3
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.230
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yes.

4
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.230
Yutaka OIWA: Hello!

5
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.570
Luigi Iannone: Hello, you Tucker!

6
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.269
Yutaka OIWA: I don't know.

7
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.299
Yutaka OIWA: What time are you in?

8
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.589
Yutaka OIWA: This is 5 o'clock in the morning here in Europe.

9
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.135
Yutaka OIWA: Oh, oh, it's not playing.

10
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.149
Luigi Iannone: Early. Wake up.

11
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.600
Luigi Iannone: I better do not open my webcam, so you don't have to see me in the morning.

12
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:20.709
Luigi Iannone: By the way you took. I saw your mail. I will give you. I will add you to the depository so that you can do direct pull request. Okay, I will do it later on.

13
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.270
Yutaka OIWA: Yep.

14
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.990
Luigi Iannone: Wait another couple of minutes, and then we will start. Okay.

15
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.580
Luigi Iannone: Okay, maybe we can start welcome everybody.

16
00:06:52.120 --> 00:07:01.760
Luigi Iannone: the agenda for today. It's actually pretty simple. I wanted to go quickly over the Github, so to make sure that everybody knows what is there.

17
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.299
Luigi Iannone: and then we can start the discussion over the

18
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:19.910
Luigi Iannone: the charter. I saw this morning that already there are a few emails you discussing over the changes changes proposed by Peter. I actually created a couple of more

19
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.770
Luigi Iannone: we request late yesterday. But the the

20
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:35.354
Luigi Iannone: they're just how to say small change proposed changes. We will go over them as well, but the the bulk is discussing the the changes that Peter

21
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:46.119
Luigi Iannone: has proposed. So not to go on, I will switch actually to the key tab.

22
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.840
Luigi Iannone: Are you able to to read comfortably the

23
00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:06.280
Luigi Iannone: okay? As I said, the last time I I created an organization in their organization there are 3 main repositories. So the Github Github is just

24
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:16.070
Luigi Iannone: for the organization itself the meetings. I added all the meetings that we have. So

25
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:23.120
Luigi Iannone: this one is today, the planet entering meetings that we have until the next itf.

26
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.110
Luigi Iannone: and there are links to past meetings.

27
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:34.515
Luigi Iannone: And for each and every meeting meeting there is a a calendar file, so that for you should be easy to

28
00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:46.831
Luigi Iannone: to add the for in your calendar, so you know, don't forget to wake up early or go late to bed, depending on your time zones. Okay?

29
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:53.520
Luigi Iannone: And the other main repository is about the charter.

30
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.619
Luigi Iannone: Here we go.

31
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.070
Luigi Iannone: The

32
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:09.519
Luigi Iannone: original file is the one that was submitted and prepared early this year, I mean before the the official buff.

33
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:15.883
Luigi Iannone: and we can work on that based on on proposal changes with pull request.

34
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:26.860
Luigi Iannone: the most important, I would say by now is the one so submitted by Peter, which

35
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.930
Luigi Iannone: you can find here on your screen. Now, my screen sharing

36
00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:39.610
Luigi Iannone: Peter, do you? You want to go over quickly on the changes that you you proposed

37
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.550
Luigi Iannone: in order to start the discussion.

38
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:48.337
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yes, yes, thank you, Luigi and I I saw Diego has joined. Thank you for joining in this

39
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.140
Peter Chunchi Liu: challenging hours in Europe.

40
00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:56.160
Diego Lopez: Okay, there are even worse hours. Don't don't worry, thank you.

41
00:09:56.937 --> 00:10:24.852
Peter Chunchi Liu: Right? So quickly go through my changes. Actually, I made the changes per few you know principles or so. So the 1st one is that I changed, you know, from the last buff changed from the goal of this working group, from from you know, routing only on top of trusted devices becomes. We want proofs, you know. Prove proving. You know the

42
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:45.250
Peter Chunchi Liu: that our our data will be and has been, you know, forwarded on security qualifying devices. So I think the the focus slightly changes from orchestration and path computation into

43
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:57.020
Peter Chunchi Liu: proof generation. So how do we collect the trustworthiness information of the underlying devices and links?

44
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:04.450
Peter Chunchi Liu: So in this case you can maybe scroll down a little bit, Luigi, into the

45
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.089
Peter Chunchi Liu: a little bit more, a little bit more.

46
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.770
Peter Chunchi Liu: I'll come back. So a little bit more.

47
00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:32.439
Peter Chunchi Liu: So there's out of scope. Line 28, I said. The path. Computation according to client security requirements is a due elsewhere. So in this case we assume that we should provide some kind of you know, client service model to present to the client

48
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:43.260
Peter Chunchi Liu: to show like this like a menu. These are the security items that we can provide from the operator perspective. And you can choose these items.

49
00:11:43.680 --> 00:12:09.350
Peter Chunchi Liu: and if you, after you have chosen your preferred security items, the operator will orchestrate this path, but this will you know, belong, you know, somewhere in the routing area. But since we're placed in the security area, and our topic is slightly, you know, in between security and operations. Visualization.

50
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.639
Peter Chunchi Liu: This part of path computation should somehow it might.

51
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:22.210
Peter Chunchi Liu: Humble opinion is something that we can do like a separate draft in a separate working group like Pce or Spring.

52
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:32.470
Peter Chunchi Liu: This should be still in total, a full solution in total. But it's just not here. So just this is just a just a thinking.

53
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:39.479
Peter Chunchi Liu: And basically, if we can go up

54
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.150
Peter Chunchi Liu: do we? Yes, I'm gonna go up.

55
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:50.450
Peter Chunchi Liu: So that's the main change from orchestrating the path

56
00:12:50.470 --> 00:13:01.669
Peter Chunchi Liu: into proving that a orchestrated path have desired security, attributes and statuses.

57
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:10.869
Peter Chunchi Liu: So when I say, attributes and statuses that includes the security, configuration, the security functions that enabled.

58
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:26.109
Peter Chunchi Liu: and, for example, like, is it properly configured into the you know, the the latest, the security versions? Is it Ipsec or Macsec enabled these kind of information.

59
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:38.900
Peter Chunchi Liu: And also I kind of changed the trustworthiness into a more conservative term like I changed trustworthy, trustworthy

60
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.310
Peter Chunchi Liu: to security qualify.

61
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.719
Peter Chunchi Liu: So we we don't want to

62
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:54.170
Peter Chunchi Liu: be very subjective to define, like what is trust and what is not, which could, you know, lead to a lot of controversy and arguments?

63
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.029
Peter Chunchi Liu: So in this case.

64
00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:06.420
Peter Chunchi Liu: we, as operators and vendors, only want to provide a connection service to the client that meets his security requests.

65
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.860
Peter Chunchi Liu: Okay?

66
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:18.870
Peter Chunchi Liu: And for line 22, that that's number. That's the change. Number 2. So number one is to change the orchestration into generating proofs, security proofs.

67
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:25.480
Peter Chunchi Liu: and number 2 is that changing the term from trustworthy to security qualifying.

68
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.520
Peter Chunchi Liu: And the number 3 is that, you know, line 22.

69
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:37.329
Peter Chunchi Liu: I kind of mentioned like for what? What domains that we are operating.

70
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.830
Peter Chunchi Liu: So in here, like initial sorry.

71
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:50.899
Peter Chunchi Liu: Initially, we work on a simple source, routing path in one limited domain, and also.

72
00:14:51.120 --> 00:15:03.719
Peter Chunchi Liu: as we discussed before, like connecting this single path in 2 different domains. So we will need some kind of inter ISP message format.

73
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:04.990
Peter Chunchi Liu: Okay?

74
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.910
Peter Chunchi Liu: So these are the 3 main changes from my side

75
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:15.110
Peter Chunchi Liu: and reflecting on the work items, can you slide a little bit down

76
00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:22.643
Peter Chunchi Liu: right? So regarding on the work items

77
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.229
Peter Chunchi Liu: so we still have Nas use cases and requirements.

78
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:35.560
Peter Chunchi Liu: And we also have Nazar architecture. That is basically a if you're familiar with rats working group.

79
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:43.730
Peter Chunchi Liu: So they have annotation results for each different device. So basically, our NASA architecture is.

80
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:52.739
Peter Chunchi Liu: how do we collect them? How do we collect each individual device's attestation results or evidences such that they can combine

81
00:15:52.760 --> 00:16:02.509
Peter Chunchi Liu: into one group attestation result for a network path. So this is the nether architecture.

82
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:22.669
Peter Chunchi Liu: document and the the service model, I think. I mentioned mailing is working on is a document that looks like a menu in the restaurant, right? So these are the security items or services that an operator can provide to the clients, and the clients can choose from it.

83
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.929
Peter Chunchi Liu: and line number 39 is the path annotation claim set.

84
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:40.389
Peter Chunchi Liu: So we will need. We mentioned, like in as architecture, there's like a procedure to aggregate and combine each individual device's security proofs.

85
00:16:40.510 --> 00:17:04.570
Peter Chunchi Liu: So it would need some if coding and formatting format. So how do we define a path, level attestation claim set in a very similar to the rats working group? The entity attestation token. So what does it look like? What's this format? What is the encoding format?

86
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:11.900
Peter Chunchi Liu: And the last one is proof of transit. So these are my proposed changes. And you know.

87
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.870
Peter Chunchi Liu: guys, what do you look? What do you think.

88
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:26.550
Luigi Iannone: If I may start. there are in general good changes is

89
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.155
Luigi Iannone: progress for the world. In my opinion, the fact that we

90
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:42.780
Luigi Iannone: we drop the orchestration pattern path routing part is, I think, important is good. The suggestion that yes, Yutaka.

91
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:48.029
Yutaka OIWA: I am completely objective to that conclusion. So.

92
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:57.299
Yutaka OIWA: as I, my memory is about the last officer between precedent so

93
00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.485
Yutaka OIWA: and so there are so many new

94
00:18:02.762 --> 00:18:06.299
Yutaka OIWA: output outside people. Who are really yeah.

95
00:18:07.704 --> 00:18:10.670
Yutaka OIWA: interested in the whole service model.

96
00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:17.330
Yutaka OIWA: Not just limited to the single domain. So people and ha! They are interested in how

97
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.359
Yutaka OIWA: they can actually use that. So

98
00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:28.160
Yutaka OIWA: as I I sent in the mailing list today, seeing this separate

99
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.728
Yutaka OIWA: just received. So dropping

100
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.260
Yutaka OIWA: that is a completely opposite

101
00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.190
Yutaka OIWA: is a tendency of the both comments. I I believe so.

102
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.749
Luigi Iannone: I mean it, didn't you? You took out? Wait, wait a minute.

103
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:54.409
Luigi Iannone: if I may. There is a difference between routing and interdomain. NASA. Solution.

104
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.890
Luigi Iannone: You don't need the 1st to have the second, in my opinion.

105
00:19:00.377 --> 00:19:26.800
Luigi Iannone: And there is already some wording in the current charter that is there about NASA will work in the future in order to extend the mechanism to inter domain and complex topologies. Right we can keep that. I mean the fact that you have another solution, that you can use it inter domain.

106
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.390
Luigi Iannone: This one thing.

107
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.330
Yutaka OIWA: But we we don't need.

108
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:37.060
Luigi Iannone: Define the path in each and every domain. This can be left still

109
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:43.870
Luigi Iannone: to some, for each ISP to solve with pce, or something else.

110
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:54.480
Yutaka OIWA: In my comments, so louding Protocol is out of the scope, do elsewhere, but orchestration cannot be separated, so

111
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.699
Yutaka OIWA: we should not include at least orchestration time. There.

112
00:20:03.146 --> 00:20:07.389
Luigi Iannone: Do you mean that Nasser should work as well on the orchestration itself?

113
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.379
Yutaka OIWA: At least to some extent.

114
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:21.750
Yutaka OIWA: So because that is my view is that what to verify with another

115
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:30.579
Yutaka OIWA: is in current implementation tightly related to orchestration, it cannot be separately implemented. So

116
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.439
Yutaka OIWA: that's my view of the current implementation in the year, right?

117
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:41.717
Yutaka OIWA: Internet service operators. So so yeah, so like

118
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.159
Yutaka OIWA: Rip or Ospf or Bcp. Is completely out of scope.

119
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:56.530
Yutaka OIWA: But but they provide is currently managed mostly in the orchestration domain. So

120
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.620
Yutaka OIWA: that's why I am arguing with that. Addition.

121
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.099
Yutaka OIWA: we should be more careful about what

122
00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:09.200
Yutaka OIWA: to be removed within what should be integrated.

123
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:11.590
Yutaka OIWA: Click.

124
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.559
Diego Lopez: But but but I would say, if I if I may.

125
00:21:16.741 --> 00:21:28.789
Diego Lopez: I would say that in that in that respect the the charter is not. I mean, it's not explicitly forwarding that we discussed the organization.

126
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:36.889
Diego Lopez: What he's saying is that we are not going to focus on on orchestration at the beginning. And and I think what is important is that

127
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:52.059
Diego Lopez: for the moment, what we're trying to focus necessary on the how data about the the path flows. I mean how we we may saying, well, in this path you have this property and this other property.

128
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.159
Diego Lopez: and they are they are there, and they are verifiable.

129
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.130
Diego Lopez: The decisions that you take on that

130
00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.400
Diego Lopez: are put for the moment out of scope.

131
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:08.890
Diego Lopez: It's it's not saying that you cannot use it for orchestration is that we are not going to specify how you express

132
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.329
Diego Lopez: your orchestration decisions in terms of NASA. Because, NASA,

133
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.460
Diego Lopez: we are trying to focus it on the

134
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:27.499
Diego Lopez: on the information towards the orchestrator, and not the the information that comes from the orchestrator, because we are focusing on the properties of the path

135
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.059
Diego Lopez: and not on, the on, the, on, the control of the path.

136
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:32.889
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I.

137
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:39.680
Diego Lopez: And in that sense, in that sense, we are. We are exposing data and to to make the decision.

138
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.829
Diego Lopez: What we are limiting in the, in the scope is

139
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:50.520
Diego Lopez: from where the or how the how the the information is built.

140
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.369
Diego Lopez: It's built in that within a single domain.

141
00:22:54.910 --> 00:23:01.460
Diego Lopez: What group sing because we are not. We are not trying to start the discussion about the trust

142
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:21.370
Diego Lopez: cross domains in your domain. You tell me something about your your environment, and then how I establish trust with your domain is something that is kept out for the moment. This important is for the moment, and I think that, being starting with a narrow scope.

143
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.560
Diego Lopez: Buddha law was a better.

144
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.029
Yutaka OIWA: Is he?

145
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:35.419
Yutaka OIWA: I repeated the saying that should be done concurrently, at least concurrently. So who decided?

146
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:45.770
Yutaka OIWA: I about that? So yes, that is, yeah, that is, yeah. I understand that your

147
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:54.030
Yutaka OIWA: about a 2 year program. But I'm still thinking how Reese

148
00:23:54.910 --> 00:24:01.645
Yutaka OIWA: can use this and important point us, and I sent to the email that so important point is,

149
00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:12.700
Yutaka OIWA: yeah, we need some information from orchestration layer, not not directly from the website like,

150
00:24:14.552 --> 00:24:20.270
Yutaka OIWA: what were the how can you say so?

151
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:36.929
Peter Chunchi Liu: So you talk. We were kind of agreed on like we work on top of, you know, remote attestation working groups outputs.

152
00:24:37.438 --> 00:24:42.489
Peter Chunchi Liu: So I I think that's a agreement that we made before so exposed.

153
00:24:43.552 --> 00:24:50.049
Yutaka OIWA: Where? Where we what do you mean by before? So

154
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.769
Yutaka OIWA: I I attended for for a long time about NASA and I.

155
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:06.360
Yutaka OIWA: I do not remember. We we will use that

156
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.990
Yutaka OIWA: that we agreed. But we are to.

157
00:25:12.742 --> 00:25:22.710
Yutaka OIWA: I'm I'm not proposing completely new items. So I I really like the email authorization things. And

158
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:32.480
Yutaka OIWA: we are just discussing how that can putting severe values to the a user. So yeah.

159
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.020
Yutaka OIWA: I'm just discussing about how we can use that result.

160
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:47.070
Diego Lopez: No, yeah. But but that's how is something is

161
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:57.999
Diego Lopez: what what we can standardize, or what we can build a standard on is is on on the on the information you can send.

162
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:07.059
Diego Lopez: the decisions is, it's like when you when you are having an Sd. And you're having an Sd. And controller. You rely on the application.

163
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:20.520
Diego Lopez: on the sorry, on the on the protocol. What you can change between the controller, but on the on the logic of the of the Controller. Standardizing. This is complicated. We can consider

164
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:44.309
Diego Lopez: that's something that for the document of the use cases and and we are not stopping the discussion on the use cases on this in the document on use cases, we can for sure, we can mention, the the logic for making some decisions about routing through a path that has certain properties, or about deciding the most the safest of

165
00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:51.340
Diego Lopez: better path. And this is something that on the on the use cases we can do. We can discuss about that

166
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.309
Diego Lopez: mandating or having a document that talks about this logic

167
00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:09.699
Diego Lopez: that goes beyond the use case is something that at least at this stage, I I think that it would make you know the area directors or other all there in the in the Itf community uneasy, at least

168
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:29.919
Diego Lopez: so so I think that in the use cases in the use case and the and the considerations about the use case the use cases. We are not saying that we you cannot. We cannot address an orchestrator that is natural, aware, and that chooses the best path, etc. And this is something that we can focus there. And this could be part of the of the work

169
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.550
Diego Lopez: of the initial work to be done

170
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:40.910
Diego Lopez: without any any problem because it's a use case. It's a clear use case that you take NASA for for orchestration, or or

171
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:46.060
Diego Lopez: or for rather other routing decisions.

172
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:56.520
Diego Lopez: I think that's that's more than okay. But this I believe it's good that we don't make an express mention to orchestration in the in the chatter.

173
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.170
Diego Lopez: you know, because otherwise we we risk a strong.

174
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:13.006
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, i i i understand your point. So we I. My proposal is not mentioned in both positive and negative way, just saying about that.

175
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.140
Diego Lopez: Okay, so what would your chance saying in there.

176
00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:34.220
Yutaka OIWA: And maybe maybe I can make some counter proposal for that. I understand your point, and we are not standardizing the behavior of the orchestration that I completely agree.

177
00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:45.140
Yutaka OIWA: So so I can. I will make some update updated proposal for

178
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:49.490
Yutaka OIWA: how I think it should be later.

179
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.669
Yutaka OIWA: I just see? So this

180
00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:01.430
Yutaka OIWA: Peter's proposal just this morning. So oh, yeah.

181
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:06.330
Luigi Iannone: Adapt. I mean, there is 2 things. One is

182
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:26.010
Luigi Iannone: some wording in in the charter that you can propose. Obviously, the second is about the the. As Diego was mentioning the use cases and problem statement document you, you can propose text for that document which includes what? What your specific use case.

183
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.460
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

184
00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.920
Luigi Iannone: Now, then, we have to be a little bit careful on the

185
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:38.071
Luigi Iannone: how we show the priority that we give to the different use cases and solutions.

186
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:46.149
Luigi Iannone: vis-a-vis of the Isg, just not to give the impression that we really want to do everything at once.

187
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.630
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

188
00:29:47.780 --> 00:30:16.279
Luigi Iannone: which doesn't mean that we. We do not have to work at all on your use case, but you are free and welcome to work on your Us. Case and propose solution for your your use case in parallel. As you said, it's just that we needed to prioritize a little bit the works in, not give the impression that we we, we have a large scope where and we want to so solve everything at once.

189
00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.230
Yutaka OIWA: Hmm, yeah.

190
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.890
Ray Atarashi: Hello!

191
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:25.730
Yutaka OIWA: The it it address, and please.

192
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:27.117
Ray Atarashi: I'm so sorry.

193
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.220
Ray Atarashi: Can I speak something?

194
00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:30.990
Luigi Iannone: Sure.

195
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:47.079
Ray Atarashi: Okay, my name is Japan. I'm working at the and I also agree the orchestration is to scope. But the. We need the some information about our orchestrator.

196
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.299
Ray Atarashi: and I also proposed that that's some kind of a news quiz.

197
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.670
Ray Atarashi: I got ISP's point of view.

198
00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:01.990
Ray Atarashi: and in this discussion. I I need in in this point. In this time.

199
00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.510
Ray Atarashi: I agree to that. How to death?

200
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:13.805
Ray Atarashi: Some, how can I say that? Yeah, we need we? We need some some element or some

201
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:23.299
Ray Atarashi: database like element to exchange the information from the orchestrator.

202
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:29.750
Ray Atarashi: I think this kind of element is needed at the service model.

203
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:40.151
Ray Atarashi: So I, I'd like to contribute to the discuss it at service model to think about

204
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:45.182
Ray Atarashi: the information modeling at the let's obvious. Yeah.

205
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.480
Ray Atarashi: So and also the use cases.

206
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.670
Diego Lopez: So.

207
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:59.519
Yutaka OIWA: Okay? Can a proposal, then.

208
00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:04.509
Yutaka OIWA: can I see the schedule for the next meetings?

209
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.150
Luigi Iannone: Yes, give me a second. Yep.

210
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:28.870
Peter Chunchi Liu: We mentioned, like the service model thing is the thing that we, we exchange information between operators and clients. And there's something that mailing is actively working on. She has a github repo that you can contribute text to.

211
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:31.400
Yutaka OIWA: And that's.

212
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:37.359
Diego Lopez: What I was about to say that what Ray was mentioning is precisely the service model. Yeah.

213
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:49.309
Yutaka OIWA: Okay. And next is January. Okay? So 8, how about next next meeting?

214
00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.440
Luigi Iannone: Give me a second.

215
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.890
Yutaka OIWA: Sitkant.

216
00:32:54.680 --> 00:33:00.810
Luigi Iannone: So the next one after the 8th of January is the 20 second of January.

217
00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.869
Luigi Iannone: Same time, like today.

218
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:04.470
Diego Lopez: Okay.

219
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:05.590
Diego Lopez: Lovely.

220
00:33:06.676 --> 00:33:07.630
Luigi Iannone: Oh, yeah.

221
00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:08.629
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, yeah, okay.

222
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.150
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

223
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:11.340
Yutaka OIWA: Then.

224
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.750
Peter Chunchi Liu: We can postpone a little bit like 2. 2 h later, if.

225
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:31.670
Diego Lopez: No, no, no, no, that it's not that bad. Don't, don't worry. I. Personally, I wake up very, very, very often at this time, because I have to take an early train to Madrid, so don't worry about at least for me, not.

226
00:33:31.945 --> 00:33:35.520
Luigi Iannone: Same for me. And there is a second thing. We have a schedule

227
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:45.649
Luigi Iannone: took some time to set up the schedule. Let's not change it so that not confuse even more the things I would

228
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:56.180
Luigi Iannone: leave it. As it is, I mean, it's not ideal for everyone, for every meeting meeting, but it's a little bit of an effort. It's not big deal to me, at least.

229
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.510
Peter Chunchi Liu: Got it? Thanks.

230
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.440
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah. Oh, okay, for the

231
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:15.290
Yutaka OIWA: use case document. I led it. And told how we can a context

232
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.840
Yutaka OIWA: give it something like that. But

233
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:24.800
Yutaka OIWA: current. My observation is that we can have more how to say.

234
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:35.999
Yutaka OIWA: Document, another document for a big perspective of the our problems. Etya mentioned currently in the background section.

235
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.100
Peter Chunchi Liu: And

236
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:42.380
Yutaka OIWA: For a part of a important part of that, we

237
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:48.759
Yutaka OIWA: can actually include the current Peters for bother for the

238
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:53.729
Yutaka OIWA: use case for the single domain thing. So anyway, maybe as a

239
00:34:53.880 --> 00:35:00.860
Yutaka OIWA: either as a separate update to Peter's document or some how to say

240
00:35:01.803 --> 00:35:12.320
Yutaka OIWA: larger scope document separately. In either way, I will provide some document to the January.

241
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:20.039
Yutaka OIWA: maybe, if possible, I will submit by 8, and at least at least before the 20 second. So and.

242
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.200
Luigi Iannone: You can also subscribe.

243
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:30.250
Yutaka OIWA: The an initial document or the initial contribution for the 8.th That doesn't need to be final, so that we can start the discussion, you know.

244
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.259
Yutaka OIWA: of course. Okay.

245
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:40.428
Yutaka OIWA: So then, if I can share such a view about that, we can more agree with

246
00:35:41.615 --> 00:35:47.794
Yutaka OIWA: at least for scoping, I we some opinion, strong opinion. But for ordering

247
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.180
Yutaka OIWA: organization we can do more smoothly.

248
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.580
Yutaka OIWA: Discuss the thing currently. So

249
00:35:54.620 --> 00:36:02.349
Yutaka OIWA: my con big concern is a problem statement. So I can. I. I'm completely agree with fast.

250
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:08.169
Yutaka OIWA: almost practically agree with a fast fiction of the current charter.

251
00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.260
Yutaka OIWA: But for a problem statement we may

252
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:15.130
Yutaka OIWA: have a more bigger problem. And for solution.

253
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.699
Yutaka OIWA: Peter's current proposal is very important

254
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:25.779
Yutaka OIWA: thing we have to solve, so that my yes, I will ex try to express that in

255
00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:33.350
Yutaka OIWA: some more document and discuss in a so 20 second, is that possible for me?

256
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.780
Luigi Iannone: Sure.

257
00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.980
Luigi Iannone: So I

258
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.949
Luigi Iannone: There are 2

259
00:36:43.280 --> 00:37:02.860
Luigi Iannone: to a couple of messages in the chat just to to share, so mailing is not able to speak the mic, so she will share the the link for the service model draft on the mailing list so that people can contribute. And secondly, I will read that the question that she put on the

260
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:14.900
Luigi Iannone: on the chat so that we can discuss. So where does the past information data come from? My suggestion is to collect the security attributes of nodes through Pgp. Ls.

261
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:30.030
Luigi Iannone: we only need some extension who decides the forwarding path. We use the Controller to decide. Of course, this is in the same domain. Do we need to clarify what specific functions are needed to implement the Nasr Controller.

262
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:34.919
Diego Lopez: I don't. Wanna.

263
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:41.279
Diego Lopez: I let me insist on this. I would say

264
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.135
Diego Lopez: for the moment, no, I mean the nasser nasser

265
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:55.450
Diego Lopez: should be focused on the what is focused right now on the charter is is about how we provide the information

266
00:37:55.857 --> 00:38:01.382
Diego Lopez: to the to to make the decisions is, it's it's about how the information about the

267
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:09.639
Diego Lopez: security stages or other attributes from the different past elements is is provided.

268
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:22.112
Diego Lopez: then how they, this information is changed, applied becomes part of the logic is something that I I for the moment would keep outside of the

269
00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.070
Diego Lopez: of the of the of the charter

270
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:31.489
Diego Lopez: things think for one second about rat. That is, somehow our mother group

271
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.683
Diego Lopez: rats doesn't make any any

272
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:46.249
Diego Lopez: What is about the evidence? How you exchange the how you exchange the evidence, and how do you make, how you build them?

273
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:52.880
Diego Lopez: The logic about how you take decisions about that, etc. Is something that is left out.

274
00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:06.769
Diego Lopez: which doesn't imply that in the architecture Jew don't consider, for example, the vertifier and the policies, etcetera. And when Russ started they were very much concerned about the

275
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:11.510
Diego Lopez: about the evidences and about the talking, so the help

276
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.400
Diego Lopez: they were exchanged. They started later on to talk about

277
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:41.609
Diego Lopez: how the policies could be applies applied how to change policies, and how, for example, you could right now they are talking about multi-party or multi-party attestation and things like that. But they have done that later, when the base, the base protocol, was was established, I I think it's a it's a wise

278
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.900
Diego Lopez: strategy to start with

279
00:39:45.150 --> 00:40:06.020
Diego Lopez: the the base mechanisms, which is how data about the path is provided and built, how we establish trust of that. And then then, once we have the the group. The group has become mature enough, and we have a solid ground for this to start discussing about, for example, Bgpls extension, etcetera.

280
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:08.939
Yutaka OIWA: He's up for.

281
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:17.810
Luigi Iannone: Follow up a comment on on the chat from mailing Diego. Why need to to exchange the evidence into domain? Just need a baseline.

282
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.950
Luigi Iannone: Do we need to consider multi domain just 2 domain.

283
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.910
Diego Lopez: I

284
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:37.239
Diego Lopez: I think that we will need to do that. I mean by definition, the not only the Internet, mobile networks are multi-domain by definition, even even to connect to operators that makes sense. But again.

285
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:44.249
Diego Lopez: I I bought. I bought focus for the moment the charter on the single domain environment.

286
00:40:44.250 --> 00:41:09.030
Diego Lopez: and once once we have the group running, we have a clear view. How we do this, we can extend the charter, or ask for an extension of the charter to consider multi domain, to consider, to consider the incorporation of NASA information in route well, in, in some kind of routing change, information, protocol not necessarily routing protocols, etc. This is but I would leave this for

287
00:41:09.408 --> 00:41:10.920
Diego Lopez: for a second step

288
00:41:11.716 --> 00:41:18.299
Diego Lopez: let me insist. I'm not say I'm not trying to limit it, to limit how Nasser is going to be used.

289
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:21.780
Diego Lopez: I'm just trying to to send the message

290
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:33.569
Diego Lopez: to to the, to the, to the community in general and to area directors, etc, that we have a clear and focused scope to start with.

291
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:38.049
Diego Lopez: Yes, let's start by the by, the basic foundations. That's that's all.

292
00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:49.310
Luigi Iannone: I do agree. I, I think the discussion comes also to what Utah said, in the sense that we we can keep the the multi domain inter domain

293
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.080
Luigi Iannone: use case in the problem statement.

294
00:41:52.440 --> 00:42:14.499
Luigi Iannone: But we, we, we have to to say to the Isg that we, we will start with the intra domain, let's say, single domain, or, as mailing is suggesting in the chat, one to one domain. So 2 domains, just 2 domains, something very, very simple. We don't. Don't go for the very general

295
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:31.639
Luigi Iannone: directly solving the very general use case, so that we prove to the Isg that we we tackle a problem that is solvable within the scope of the Etf, and then we will work further to extend it.

296
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:32.980
Diego Lopez: I think.

297
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.819
Yutaka OIWA: Good I can. I have 2 comments.

298
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.730
Luigi Iannone: Sure.

299
00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:46.729
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah part of the thing. If we it is still in scope of the working group. As long as it is a part of working group. I can work

300
00:42:47.535 --> 00:43:02.680
Yutaka OIWA: with individual item within the scope of the working group is completely acceptable for me to work on that. And second comment is, yeah, foundation is important, and we can do

301
00:43:03.542 --> 00:43:13.969
Yutaka OIWA: one by one. I for that view, I agree with Diego, but for building up to solve the

302
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:19.250
Yutaka OIWA: final problem. We should have.

303
00:43:20.199 --> 00:43:26.790
Yutaka OIWA: how to say, do both top to down and go to app. So

304
00:43:27.614 --> 00:43:34.090
Yutaka OIWA: if we build completely from bottom to one step to one step, upper and upper.

305
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:37.580
Yutaka OIWA: we will have some layer solution. So

306
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.670
Yutaka OIWA: that's why I am really focusing on the

307
00:43:43.126 --> 00:43:51.490
Yutaka OIWA: some broader architecture. And I I can work on that in some way

308
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:59.320
Yutaka OIWA: for next submission, and possibly within working group, so that the another solution can be.

309
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:08.719
Yutaka OIWA: how? How does it smoothly embedded finally into the their system? So

310
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.839
Yutaka OIWA: am I interested in working on that way. So we can.

311
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.479
Yutaka OIWA: I believe we can cooperate.

312
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:19.130
Yutaka OIWA: Is that perspective.

313
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:37.579
Luigi Iannone: Utah from a stick. Procedural point of view. You can you? You can work on any individual submission that you wish in the past. In my experience it did happen in my working groups that some people work it on individual draft submission

314
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:44.979
Luigi Iannone: for extending or a different use case, and it was not possible to adopt the work, because was not

315
00:44:45.576 --> 00:44:59.210
Luigi Iannone: didn't fall into the charter, but later on we rechartered it, and then we included the work in the working group, but the individual submission was already discussed in the working group.

316
00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.940
Luigi Iannone: We were just not able to adopt it.

317
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:17.989
Luigi Iannone: So, working on what you think would be the solution of the interdomain, even if it's not in the scope of NASA Charter. Now you can do it at some point. We we we, we can recharter and work on it.

318
00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.020
Luigi Iannone: So that did.

319
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:20.990
Luigi Iannone: There's different.

320
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:29.700
Yutaka OIWA: That thing for that thing. Can I make some personal discussion somewhere before the Bangkok meeting.

321
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:39.089
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, I mean the fact that that the interdomain use case is not directly in in the charter now doesn't mean that nobody is allowed to work on it

322
00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:46.710
Luigi Iannone: to be clear. But we we will not be a a main effort of the working group.

323
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.566
Luigi Iannone: That's the the the point.

324
00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.605
Yutaka OIWA: Maybe I can.

325
00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:02.109
Yutaka OIWA: I can have some. We can have some companies. I I want to talk separately with that thing.

326
00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:12.280
Luigi Iannone: Okay. Anyway, you know, I I important point, I think, is that you you contribute to the problem statement to so to make sure that that your use case is included somehow.

327
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.470
Luigi Iannone: Okay, so.

328
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.240
Yutaka OIWA: Cases. Yeah, their case can be other.

329
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:21.129
Yutaka OIWA: How to say address can be addressed in

330
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:27.319
Yutaka OIWA: future definitely. So that's that's my possible one of that my

331
00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.410
Yutaka OIWA: mostly possible contribution to the working group. I think.

332
00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.249
Luigi Iannone: anybody wants to share any other opinion on the chatter. So far.

333
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:54.921
Diego Lopez: Well, I I have a few notes, but are are minor, and I can. I think that there's some articles, and so

334
00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.300
Diego Lopez: things. I saw the message from

335
00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:08.149
Diego Lopez: from Peter that that there was some that there was some problems with the pull requests. So I I refrain from from doing so.

336
00:47:08.845 --> 00:47:09.160
Luigi Iannone: But

337
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:19.139
Luigi Iannone: request the the here is the thing in Github. Normally the normal procedure is, you fork the repository, and then you you propose.

338
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:19.500
Diego Lopez: Yeah.

339
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:37.210
Luigi Iannone: Request unless you are you. You have right access to the to the repository which for me is not an issue at all to give. It's just the procedure is, you drop an email. And I add you, that's it. So it's not a problem.

340
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:53.826
Diego Lopez: Okay? No, no, I have no problem with forking the repository and sending the pull request. This is simply simply that I decided to refrain from making the pull request. Just for that, my my only main concern. There is a 2 2 main concerns that because the other are totally minor.

341
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.500
Diego Lopez: when is on the when talking about this simple sales routing path

342
00:48:00.469 --> 00:48:08.620
Diego Lopez: is is online. Oh, I don't. This is the working group we initially focuses on the focus on the the idea of the

343
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:10.690
Diego Lopez: of the single domain.

344
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:20.139
Diego Lopez: If there we we mentioned that this they will initially focus on a simple sales routing path.

345
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:26.420
Diego Lopez: Why are we focusing on a simple source routing simply, is it.

346
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:30.159
Luigi Iannone: Let me go back to the chatter.

347
00:48:31.351 --> 00:48:34.860
Yutaka OIWA: That was also technical concern for me.

348
00:48:37.065 --> 00:48:43.529
Peter Chunchi Liu: We can't move it. It's just, you know, if we start with Srv. 6 or something. It's

349
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.850
Peter Chunchi Liu: easy for you to understand.

350
00:48:46.240 --> 00:49:01.480
Diego Lopez: Again. I'm not saying that is, for sure. That's it's because if I limit into sales routing, then we are limiting the the use cases, I would say, instead of focus on on simple, on simple paths

351
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:12.659
Diego Lopez: and and simple that, or or even focus on paths in limited domains. And that's all. I mean, I would not qualify that this is going to be source routing, or or whatever else. Simply that.

352
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:15.129
Peter Chunchi Liu: I agree. I agree. Yes.

353
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:24.529
Yutaka OIWA: For that purpose. If possible. We ideally prefer the separate smaller, change it for

354
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:32.539
Yutaka OIWA: for request, so that we can do this kind of technical discussion one by one.

355
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:40.849
Luigi Iannone: What I propose is the following, I will merge the the pull request of Peter into the charter.

356
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:50.903
Luigi Iannone: and then we, because my feeling is that everybody thinks it's a a good start, a good improvement of what we always.

357
00:49:51.700 --> 00:50:10.849
Luigi Iannone: and then we take it from there, and we will discuss on the mailing list for the changes, or for the pull, request, etc, etc, including the need that they like like simple source routing this will this, this point will be, anyway, in the minutes that I will prepare, so we will change it later.

358
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:14.209
Diego Lopez: That that sounds perfect. Yeah.

359
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:16.819
Yutaka OIWA: Fine.

360
00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.529
Peter Chunchi Liu: I took. I took notes. I took notes. Yeah.

361
00:50:19.982 --> 00:50:26.774
Yutaka OIWA: I I prefer keeping this in Pr path, but it's it's finally religious decision. But

362
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:28.990
Yutaka OIWA: it's not fine.

363
00:50:29.435 --> 00:50:32.550
Luigi Iannone: Guys just to to have a 1-one

364
00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.840
Luigi Iannone: one step further. So we have a an improvement. And then we we will continue working.

365
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.349
Yutaka OIWA: Okay, okay, I just make a note for that.

366
00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:44.070
Luigi Iannone: Okay. And I will give.

367
00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:44.690
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, yeah.

368
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:49.362
Luigi Iannone: Right permission. So you can do pull request. Okay.

369
00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:58.060
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, you said, we have some agreement. So I was a bit early

370
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:03.680
Yutaka OIWA: worried about that. Yeah. But making progress is my agreement. So.

371
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:04.960
Luigi Iannone: Good, good.

372
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.189
Yutaka OIWA: It's okay. I have still a strong comment on that. But

373
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.100
Yutaka OIWA: given that, nothing is good for me.

374
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.760
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

375
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.350
Yutaka OIWA: Yep.

376
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.689
Luigi Iannone: Okay, I think we have a

377
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:27.849
Luigi Iannone: a good conclusion for this meeting. So

378
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:35.869
Luigi Iannone: unless anybody wants to rise any other question on the issue, or has any other comment would call it a day, so that

379
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:41.957
Luigi Iannone: people in some time zones can go to sleep, and others can start the day. The the working day.

380
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:52.540
Nancy: Hey, Luigi? I apologize for joining late. For some reason I had it on my calendar that it was tomorrow instead of today.

381
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.910
Luigi Iannone: Oh!

382
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:56.200
Nancy: So I realized.

383
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:13.600
Luigi Iannone: Hi, Nancy! I I can summarize. I can summarize the discussion that we had so far, so as you should have seen. There was a a big let's say a big bullet request from Peter, with several changes.

384
00:52:14.087 --> 00:52:22.400
Luigi Iannone: Discussion is already ongoing during the night for me on the mailing list, which is good. And despite

385
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:45.079
Luigi Iannone: slightly different point of view. Everybody is okay with the merging. The pull request of Peter. Because seems an improvement doesn't mean we stop with here. We we need to continue working and refine the chart that obviously, but looks like a a good improvement, so

386
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.769
Luigi Iannone: merge it, and the second point was on the inter domain.

387
00:52:51.822 --> 00:53:02.797
Luigi Iannone: Use case, let's say, for you, taka, this is an important part, so he will contribute text in the use case document in order to

388
00:53:04.337 --> 00:53:23.080
Luigi Iannone: let's say, formalize the inter domain problem doesn't mean that we need to work right away on this so that we we don't have a a huge scope, and the this, and with the risk of the isg, so to push back and say, Well, you you. It's too open, for it's too big.

389
00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:27.770
Luigi Iannone: so that we start for for with simple solutions, and then

390
00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:31.680
Luigi Iannone: at some point we can recharter and include more work.

391
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:38.369
Luigi Iannone: I would say. This is the summary, quick summary of the discussions today.

392
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:40.290
Nancy: Yeah.

393
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:49.069
Nancy: I'm not a routing expert. So I you know, I leave that to to to the writing people to comment, yeah.

394
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:52.810
Luigi Iannone: If I may. I think that the main

395
00:53:53.972 --> 00:54:08.770
Luigi Iannone: difficulty is to to find the right balance between. We don't want to do routing, but we have to do to give enough elements to choose a path. So we don't want. So

396
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:16.400
Luigi Iannone: that line is a little will be a little bit tricky to find, I think.

397
00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:17.050
Nancy: Yeah.

398
00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:26.250
Yutaka OIWA: Maybe maybe saying that in single time may make this kind of harder discussion. So we we must clearly state programs first.st

399
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.250
Yutaka OIWA: Oh, I will do that. I will try to do that.

400
00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:30.730
Luigi Iannone: Good.

401
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.987
Nancy: I mean we. So it's Cisco.

402
00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:45.009
Nancy: We were one of the editors. But Eric is no longer on the project, so we put the draft on the rat, saying.

403
00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:49.249
Nancy: This is how you can convey some of the claims.

404
00:54:49.854 --> 00:54:53.989
Nancy: And again, this is where I'm saying I'm not a routing person.

405
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:57.710
Nancy: but trying to enforce, or or

406
00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:12.559
Nancy: if, from the problem statement, you want to provide assurances for the endpoint that it's going through a trusted path. I think that was, that would be very difficult to enforce and to provide that visibility just because the path can be very

407
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.979
Nancy: not can. It is very dynamic? Is my understanding right?

408
00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:27.832
Luigi Iannone: It depends on on a lot of things.

409
00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:33.689
Luigi Iannone: and whether or not is, is is a provisioned password, or just a.

410
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:34.960
Nancy: Don't!

411
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:41.359
Luigi Iannone: Basket, so it's difficult to to answer the the. This statement for me.

412
00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:50.110
Nancy: Well, I meant it to be vague, Luigi, that's the point of controversy of.

413
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:50.770
Luigi Iannone: Yeah.

414
00:55:50.950 --> 00:56:06.129
Nancy: It was a rationale for why? We said, Okay, we'll just leave it up to the vendors to specify what that routing solution looks like, but these are the claims that can be put forward. And that was the definition that was included

415
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.000
Nancy: in the the draft. That's in rats.

416
00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:14.570
Nancy: right? And I think Tank is continuing to evolve that draft is my understanding. Yeah.

417
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:25.951
Luigi Iannone: Okay, we we can have a look to do draft on and have a similar approaches. As the claim the Nasser can

418
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:34.790
Luigi Iannone: can satisfy and can be used by the let's say, the routing people, in order to create the path that is suitable for the

419
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:37.210
Luigi Iannone: for the service, etcetera.

420
00:56:42.694 --> 00:56:47.089
Nancy: It all comes down to making sure we have a charter with a scope

421
00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.869
Nancy: appropriately fine, to appease the Iesg

422
00:56:51.486 --> 00:56:57.180
Nancy: well, and and for the people who will show up at the Boff right to get that consensus.

423
00:56:57.450 --> 00:56:58.360
Nancy: So.

424
00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.700
Luigi Iannone: Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:10.209
Luigi Iannone: Yeah. We started to to refine the the charter. I'm positive that we we will have a

426
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:15.070
Luigi Iannone: something good to present in Bangkok to the Isg. So

427
00:57:15.673 --> 00:57:23.259
Luigi Iannone: we will merge the the Peters pull, request, and refine the the

428
00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:25.799
Luigi Iannone: the chapter for that I mean.

429
00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:33.439
Luigi Iannone: the good thing is to discuss, to have everything packet on the Github, and then we can discuss on the mailing list the changes.

430
00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:36.210
Nancy: Right, having the Prs help.

431
00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:46.139
Diego Lopez: And, Nancy, let let me insist in that. Well, at least my conclusion from the from these changes is that we're going to focus.

432
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:54.849
Diego Lopez: Oh, how the information flows from the path! I mean, how? How the the security properties or the properties of the path

433
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:56.910
Diego Lopez: are made available.

434
00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:06.739
Diego Lopez: and how to establish trust on this, on this information, and not on routing decision. When I'm building the path, or whatever that is

435
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:11.340
Diego Lopez: associated with this dynamic dynamicity that you were mentioned.

436
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:27.260
Diego Lopez: mentioning that that's the idea precisely that the routing decisions and the routing protocols, etc, are not part of the charter. They can be part of the of the use cases so to be considered how this information could be used.

437
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:31.840
Diego Lopez: But the focus is on how the information is built, and which is that information.

438
00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:33.670
Nancy: Okay.

439
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:46.530
Nancy: that sounds like like a workable path, workable as in reducing contention.

440
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:48.566
Diego Lopez: Yeah, exactly.

441
00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:51.140
Luigi Iannone: Yep.

442
00:58:55.300 --> 00:59:03.029
Nancy: Okay, appreciate it. And again I apologize. I have to get the dates better on my calendar.

443
00:59:03.987 --> 00:59:09.830
Luigi Iannone: It's because of the time zone you for you is Tuesday evening. The night.

444
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.910
Nancy: Right, and the message said, Wednesday.

445
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:27.959
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my my bad, I didn't consider that for you, for for the West coast is still. Tuesday will be clear, more clear in the next messages.

446
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.849
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

447
00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:42.410
Nancy: Yeah, well, that's why. So I just need to make sure there should be a way. And then a question to Luigi moving forward. I don't know if Zoom has

448
00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:47.680
Nancy: any kind of assistance, if we want to use that for creating summaries.

449
00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:54.560
Nancy: So both recording and creating summaries of the meetings can be automated.

450
00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.110
Nancy: Webex has that capability if you want that.

451
00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:03.719
Nancy: So I'm more the next ones on Webex. If you prefer.

452
01:00:04.618 --> 01:00:13.559
Luigi Iannone: If you have a Webex account, we can use the Webex if you wish. No, no problem for me. I don't think zoom has this feature. I have to check.

453
01:00:14.507 --> 01:00:15.909
Luigi Iannone: I will check.

454
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:21.390
Nancy: Zoom has the, and that's the 1st thing when you hit the record, you know.

455
01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.590
Nancy: AI assistant is turned on, and you can see the summary highlight points.

456
01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.390
Yutaka OIWA: I, at least I see some

457
01:00:28.807 --> 01:00:33.072
Yutaka OIWA: icon for a companion, but I don't know how it works.

458
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:38.730
Nancy: Well, AI companion could be many different things.

459
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:45.335
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know what is exactly providing by zoom.

460
01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:49.520
Nancy: Well, anyway, we can discuss that later. Luigi.

461
01:00:50.057 --> 01:01:02.789
Luigi Iannone: The next meeting will be 8th of January. We have time to to decide whether we are or not. We want to go for webex, or continue using zoom or whatever.

462
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.830
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

463
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:06.970
Peter Chunchi Liu: Right.

464
01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:07.490
Yutaka OIWA: Okay. Cool.

465
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:10.670
Peter Chunchi Liu: And for today I took notes. So don't worry.

466
01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:11.880
Nancy: Oh, thank!

467
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.990
Luigi Iannone: Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Peter.

468
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:26.300
Luigi Iannone: Okay, in that case, we, we consumed. The hour has been a nice discussion.

469
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:35.210
Luigi Iannone: and I will merge the the Peter's pull request, and then we continue on the mailing list to refine the charter.

470
01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.800
Luigi Iannone: and we will prepare 10 min. Okay.

471
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:39.000
Diego Lopez: Very good.

472
01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:44.430
Nancy: Appreciate everyone for all the efforts, and have a great holiday.

473
01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.840
Luigi Iannone: Thank you.

474
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.760
Diego Lopez: Same timing.

475
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.080
Luigi Iannone: To everybody.

476
01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:51.970
Nancy: Alright, bye.
