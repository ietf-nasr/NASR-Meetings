00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.840
Meiling Chen: Hi. Louis.

2
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.990
Luigi Iannone: Hello Ming!

3
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.149
Luigi Iannone: Hello, Peter!

4
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.210
Meiling Chen: Oh, tell me you! You come back for your.

5
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.650
Luigi Iannone: Every day. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

6
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:15.360
Luigi Iannone: Here in in France, during during February's school winter holidays for 2 weeks.

7
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.420
Luigi Iannone: So usually families go to to the mountains to the hops to do some skiing.

8
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.030
Luigi Iannone: That's what I did with my kids.

9
00:04:26.206 --> 00:04:33.319
Meiling Chen: My daughter start the new teams 2 weeks ago.

10
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.240
Luigi Iannone: Hmm.

11
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.189
Peter Chunchi Liu: I'm still at the looking for the girlfriend step.

12
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.439
Luigi Iannone: A long process. Peter.

13
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.200
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yes.

14
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.250
Meiling Chen: If you need, we can help.

15
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.960
Luigi Iannone: Please please recommend.

16
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.260
Meiling Chen: I have a sister.

17
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.378
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, we can discuss it at Bangkok.

18
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:44.274
Luigi Iannone: Looks like we are in a busy way. Wednesday. Not many people joining.

19
00:09:45.374 --> 00:09:52.270
Luigi Iannone: I know Nancy will not join, because she's busy in an executive executive meeting event with Cisco.

20
00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.330
Luigi Iannone: So I mean, we are a few minutes after the hour.

21
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:10.060
Luigi Iannone: I think we can start. We are 3. We can even make it shorter unless we we have long discussion.

22
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:21.090
Luigi Iannone: So 1st of all, I contacted Alvaro

23
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:33.970
Luigi Iannone: about the the feedback from the iap, and let me me shit, I mean, is reply.

24
00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:45.709
Peter Chunchi Liu: You mean showing the slides to to him.

25
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.232
Luigi Iannone: Show the slide. I sent him the the past about

26
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.460
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yes.

27
00:10:53.576 --> 00:10:58.010
Luigi Iannone: The the Iab feedback. Okay.

28
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.266
Luigi Iannone: And I sent to him also the link to the whole slides. And

29
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:15.579
Luigi Iannone: here is what I got back. So basically, he's fine with the the slides about the Iab official feedback. And now he, we addressed

30
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:23.659
Luigi Iannone: the the concerns. Let's say he has 3 points on the charter.

31
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.800
Luigi Iannone: so the 1st one is basically leaving the definition of the use cases and terminology to the working group.

32
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.129
Luigi Iannone: Say, it's not. Maybe the ideal

33
00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:48.160
Luigi Iannone: he prefers to have a specific use cases. But this to me in the chat is just warping

34
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.140
Luigi Iannone: in the sense that

35
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:58.640
Luigi Iannone: we just need to say we will document the use cases so that we we make clear that we have them already.

36
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:06.350
Luigi Iannone: and this should also be clear for them from the presentation that the technical part of the presentation

37
00:12:07.077 --> 00:12:14.050
Luigi Iannone: that we have several use cases that that are already there. We don't need to find them.

38
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.080
Luigi Iannone: So this is a

39
00:12:18.127 --> 00:12:25.559
Luigi Iannone: not an issue to me. Second is about the use of rfc. 87, 99

40
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.709
Luigi Iannone: of unlimited domains.

41
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:43.419
Luigi Iannone: he he's right, he says. Actually, this Rfc does not come out from itf consensus. This has been submitted over the independent stream.

42
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:52.869
Luigi Iannone: So basically, was Brian carpet and Shenzhen kid that submitted to the IC editor and has been published.

43
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.950
Luigi Iannone: So he says, maybe it's not very helpful in the Isg

44
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:05.750
Luigi Iannone: and yeah, we we can drop the reference just just maintaining limited domains.

45
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.839
Luigi Iannone: And to me should be fine.

46
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:17.770
Luigi Iannone: And last point is he? He noticed it, that we, we change it source routing path to Service Pass.

47
00:13:18.909 --> 00:13:32.970
Luigi Iannone: I sent back an email saying, we we didn't want to go into source routing solution itself or technology but the only things he he knows is the to put spring

48
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.310
Luigi Iannone: as a related working group

49
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:46.880
Luigi Iannone: which makes sense, we can put it there, and if anybody ask why spring is there said at some point we need something to steer the traffic, so spring may be one option.

50
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.209
Luigi Iannone: you know. It's what do you think.

51
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.315
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, I agree. And maybe you know, even

52
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:07.569
Peter Chunchi Liu: anima like, for example, in a distributed way of, you know, establishing this path. So maybe you know. So spring definitely. And Aima, maybe. Yeah.

53
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.720
Luigi Iannone: Okay. Okay? Oh, no. We can add both of them.

54
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.590
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, absolutely.

55
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:19.239
Luigi Iannone: By the way, did you, Peter? Did you present in anima in the interim meeting.

56
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:34.129
Peter Chunchi Liu: Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. I think the feedback is is good. But the the animal working group will, you know, still wait for the outcome of our initiative before they make any decisions. I think it makes sense. You know.

57
00:14:35.155 --> 00:14:36.910
Peter Chunchi Liu: system. It's online.

58
00:14:37.613 --> 00:14:50.509
Luigi Iannone: Maybe a good idea if you drop an email on the mailing list just stating. So you did. Present was well received. And yeah, anima will follow up, depending on the result.

59
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.540
Peter Chunchi Liu: Of the bus.

60
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:53.670
Luigi Iannone: And

61
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.510
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yep.

62
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:04.080
Toerless: Yeah, I think there are. There are different approaches on on how we could, you know, leverage each other's work?

63
00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:10.720
Toerless: And so hopefully. We'll have some time to chat on the corridors or in Bangkok.

64
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.510
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

65
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.800
Luigi Iannone: And

66
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:34.861
Luigi Iannone: because I have share. I also

67
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.350
Luigi Iannone: let me go to this one

68
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:51.619
Luigi Iannone: agenda. I shared the agenda and the slides with the deck, which is our Id.

69
00:15:52.693 --> 00:16:04.539
Luigi Iannone: She's pretty fine with the agenda. Okay, pretty happy. She didn't look yet. All the slides, she will do it and and send us feedback.

70
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:18.389
Luigi Iannone: So this is pretty cool. this week or early next week I will finalize these slides because there are a few slides like to be updated. Blah blah.

71
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:29.657
Luigi Iannone: and then I will share it as well with the routing area Id followed so that we have a have also

72
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.599
Luigi Iannone: his feedback, and we'll make sure, or at least ask, that he comes to the boss

73
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:38.729
Luigi Iannone: so that we have a.

74
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:39.210
Peter Chunchi Liu: Right.

75
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:46.050
Luigi Iannone: A routing id sitting in the room.

76
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:53.400
Luigi Iannone: Maybe we can also ask to chat with him before the meeting. Why not? Could be an idea.

77
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.990
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, I think, Isg, pre review on the materials is, should should be important.

78
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.380
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, maybe more important than than just just talking.

79
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:13.829
Peter Chunchi Liu: We can reflect their feedbacks on the materials. I think the probabilities of their support should be higher.

80
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:32.514
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I also contacted. He's the the guy with the big bird that that was complaining about the the usage of routing in the name this will change it. But there was

81
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:46.920
Luigi Iannone: dumb during the panel. G he made the the observation that that

82
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:52.000
Luigi Iannone: proof of transit can be used. Let's say, kind of stand alone

83
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:57.310
Luigi Iannone: without the the attestation. Just as a service that we want to prove something. Okay.

84
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:20.079
Luigi Iannone: His point of view. I wanted to make sure that he we capture his observation, because otherwise, if he's there, he will make the same content comment to the mic. I have no reply so far, but worst case I will catch him in the corridor and ask him explicitly.

85
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.888
Luigi Iannone: what he thinks, and

86
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.590
Toerless: This is just about the naming.

87
00:18:30.989 --> 00:18:52.799
Luigi Iannone: Is a long time routing person, so he's pretty sensitive about routing, and he, like Randy Bush that was not in the room, but was remote right away. Make the comment, oh, this is not about routing. Looks more about forwarding.

88
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.989
Luigi Iannone: Okay? So that that was the main issue.

89
00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:08.150
Luigi Iannone: and then in panarchy, said, Well, maybe you can use what? Sorry, NASA. We have 2 paths right, the atticession of the path and the proof of transit.

90
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:17.220
Luigi Iannone: And he said, well, maybe the proof of transit to you can use it in some scenarios without the attestation.

91
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:40.969
Luigi Iannone: Fair enough. I would not like go into use cases where we separate the 2 parts. Otherwise we we open up the scope even more but wanted to make sure that it doesn't go again to the mic and say, Oh, maybe you can do this. You can do that and open up the the scope during the both.

92
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.489
Luigi Iannone: That's why I I put.

93
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:49.400
Toerless: So sorry. What! How do you? What would, in your opinion, unnecessary, widen the scope.

94
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.350
Luigi Iannone: The fact that you can use the proof of transit alone without the attestation.

95
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.670
Toerless: Right.

96
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.620
Luigi Iannone: That's because you want.

97
00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:05.080
Toerless: To the question that I had on the mailing list. Where does attestation start? And you know what does not constitute attestation?

98
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.730
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

99
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.110
Luigi Iannone: Does this sound.

100
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:22.820
Toerless: You know, 1 1 of the things that I that I find really enticing as as an option, is that the one component which is, you know, the packet header, in which

101
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.290
Toerless: you know we would, you know, put the proof of transit.

102
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.959
Toerless: But if

103
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:37.036
Toerless: if I simply do that on a hop by hop basis, right? So I mean, we we discussed. We have 2 type of

104
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:45.310
Toerless: you know, attestations, verifications, right? So whatever we call it, one would look at the whole path.

105
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.540
Toerless: One would only need to look at the prior hub.

106
00:20:48.700 --> 00:21:00.749
Toerless: and that actually is a great building block block that I can reuse. Whether that reuse is within NASA scope or not to me is just a process question, but it would be a great outcome to get out of NASA.

107
00:21:04.877 --> 00:21:18.830
Luigi Iannone: To be honest, thoughtless, not sure. I followed what you are saying. You you mean that you, the verification can be done. Hope by hope, without each node having the notion of the whole path

108
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.900
Luigi Iannone: just verifying. It comes from the

109
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.230
Luigi Iannone: previous hope, the right previous hope. That's what you say.

110
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:28.950
Toerless: Yes, yes.

111
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:41.089
Toerless: so so this is, for example, one of the things where you know, if I had that type of of header that, you know, is just, you know. I would think that

112
00:21:41.850 --> 00:22:00.210
Toerless: which goes back then to the details of How do we do the cryptographic part? Right? So is that a symmetric or asymmetric keying right whatever it is. But if I do receive a packet with a packet header, where I cryptographically have a knowledge that it was actually sent by the right previous hop.

113
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:15.240
Toerless: Then that is something I could use in enema. Right? So that would be one way on how to replace. For example, Ipsec tunnels with something that gives me the same degree of security that I need for my infrastructure security. Right? So

114
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:30.289
Toerless: that doesn't have to be, then you know the reuse of that header in that context, whether that is within scope of NASA, or whether that would be in scope of anima. That's all. Just process stuff to me. Right? I'm just saying that the technology is of interest to me.

115
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:37.120
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, my personal opinion. you.

116
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:48.878
Luigi Iannone: I mean, this is like, do you have a iterative mode of verification or recursive? You are suggesting a recursive method of proof of transit.

117
00:22:49.740 --> 00:23:09.509
Luigi Iannone: which may may be more lightweight if you look, but maybe more difficult to troubleshoot in some some cases. Okay? Because you if you don't have the division of the whole path, you cannot know what went wrong when it goes wrong.

118
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:23.260
Luigi Iannone: But this is something we we to me is a technical discussion to to be held. I I know I do not have a a strong opinion on one solution with with respect to the other solution.

119
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:31.259
Luigi Iannone: But I want to come back to the IP sec. Tunnel. So NASA is a proof of transit not necessarily encrypting the.

120
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:31.610
Toerless: Is it.

121
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.229
Luigi Iannone: The the packet.

122
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:34.300
Toerless: Yes.

123
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.090
Toerless: But

124
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:46.119
Toerless: so what? What we need, what we need is infrastructure security that somebody cannot inject packets that we're not interested in. Right? So that's that's 1 of the problems that we have.

125
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.170
Toerless: Yeah, yeah.

126
00:23:47.170 --> 00:24:01.789
Toerless: so similar to what these, you know, quantum people want to do. Well, they they also want to not be able to have their packets be visible. But injection of packets is one of the big challenge in existing networks. So when we encrypt, all the traffic that's been done forever.

127
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:10.629
Toerless: Right? Yeah, authenticating only the the sender, you know, and and and hence also the payload. Of course, right? So

128
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:21.199
Toerless: without the encryption. If that can be done more lightweight, then I can simply add end to end encryption to it. I don't need to do the encryption on every hop. I just need to do.

129
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.950
Luigi Iannone: I know it's.

130
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:44.849
Toerless: So I can spin the whole solution differently by taking, let's say, the encryption of the payload out of the picture. And just, you know, doing the authentication or the proof of transit. Right? So there are different ways on how I then can build the solution. So that's why that proof of transit type of header may be a great reusable component in other solutions, like an enema.

131
00:24:45.850 --> 00:25:01.018
Luigi Iannone: 100%. I agree, I see your point now. And yeah, yeah, you are absolutely right. You compared to Ipsec especially, you can have a a more lightweight solution that that allows you to

132
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:19.660
Luigi Iannone: proof the the transit, without necessarily having to encrypt the encrypt at each shop absolutely. And you can so delegate as we. We foresee in the the encryption in the security of the packet itself, end to end.

133
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.740
Toerless: Okay.

134
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.849
Luigi Iannone: You are there? Yeah.

135
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:29.940
Toerless: So so, and and that's why I obviously would love to see a header where I can have

136
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.339
Toerless: either or right or both, right so single hop, or the whole path, or both, right, so.

137
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.109
Toerless: The whole path, we know is typically for 3rd party.

138
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:47.489
Toerless: that, you know doesn't have isn't involved in the infrastructure that just wants to have the infrastructure to present what it's doing.

139
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.470
Toerless: But then the infrastructure itself.

140
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.970
Toerless: whether it's an enema, or even a scion or others, they may be perfectly happy with just a single hop.

141
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:11.519
Luigi Iannone: now about the the header or the the piece of header, that we need to add that's a good question I was thinking a little bit. So in in principle. What ideally what we need is

142
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.760
Luigi Iannone: a structure that is, that can be.

143
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:28.929
Luigi Iannone: let's say, encapsulated on different protocols. I give you an example. One thing is to have the data set pot data structure that you embed in Srv. 6.

144
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:46.219
Toerless: Oh, yeah, you need to come up with exactly how you think it should be done in Mpls and in ipv. 6, maybe even in something else, and then you have to obfuscate it, because officially responsible for the actual packetization will be other working groups.

145
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:59.699
Toerless: right? But you you already have to think ahead right? So you don't want to go with an abstract proposal to one of these forwarding groups. Give it to them, and then they stumble over something fundamentally problematic for them.

146
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.719
Luigi Iannone: Yes, sir.

147
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.040
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

148
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.829
Toerless: Process because of the different working group responsibilities that we have.

149
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:05.780
Luigi Iannone: Yeah.

150
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:14.870
Diego Lopez: But this is. This is somehow what this has been done in groups like Nsh, for example, I mean right with the with the Nsh.

151
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:32.130
Toerless: Yeah, they well, so nsh, if I remember my discussions with Jim, who was in a prior life in Cisco doing that. That that looked more to me like transport layer that wasn't really down to the network layer. So it wasn't all that difficult

152
00:27:32.718 --> 00:27:40.070
Toerless: when when we actually get more into the network layer. There's more obfuscations in ipv. 6 and Mpls.

153
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:51.420
Toerless: I mean, just just look at the the wonderful world of M. And A. And Mpls. So.

154
00:27:52.431 --> 00:28:09.790
Toerless: but that's fine. I mean, I I just wanted to, you know, I don't want to get into the technical discussion. I just, you know, wanted to see what can and cannot or should or should not be said about things to make you know the the buff go as smooth as possible.

155
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.440
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, I think you should.

156
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:24.519
Toerless: And I mean, I know, really you're from the eighties, right? So I'm as old as he's well, a little bit younger. But so we go a long way back in Germany, so let me know if I can help.

157
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.939
Luigi Iannone: No, sure, I mean I

158
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:41.130
Luigi Iannone: I was in the same company like him for a few years, and so I know him as well. Very well, but we can have a chat together.

159
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.630
Toerless: Oh, you were in German telecom.

160
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.649
Luigi Iannone: And in Deutsche Telecom. Yes, in.

161
00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:45.799
Toerless: Oh, yeah. Okay.

162
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.469
Luigi Iannone: Tea labs in Berlin for a few years.

163
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:53.350
Toerless: Yeah, no, no, I I knew him when he was back in University right when they were doing.

164
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.720
Luigi Iannone: Oh, you go a long way back, of course.

165
00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.330
Toerless: Didn't I say eighties.

166
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:04.056
Luigi Iannone: Man, I was a kid.

167
00:29:06.496 --> 00:29:07.090
Luigi Iannone: Thank you.

168
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:15.350
Luigi Iannone: So totalis, you are hiding your real age because you look younger than.

169
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:32.640
Luigi Iannone: okay. Okay, okay, so on this slide. I think we don't. And we can switch to the other ones.

170
00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:38.590
Luigi Iannone: Let's say the technical presentation

171
00:29:40.098 --> 00:29:52.649
Luigi Iannone: we need to define a little bit the the the slides. There is some more work to do. But it's okay. We. We have a 1st part with the the use cases, and then we we

172
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:58.850
Luigi Iannone: we go more on the architectural aspects of Nasser.

173
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.819
Luigi Iannone: Diego, I uploaded your slides, but for some reason the picture

174
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.468
Luigi Iannone: cannot be loaded. I don't know why.

175
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.520
Luigi Iannone: The gray out.

176
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:24.050
Diego Lopez: Okay. So no, no, something. Something happens as well was complaining that the something was not clear 2 things about this.

177
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:39.239
Diego Lopez: first, st I'll I'll I'll try to to rebuild new ones and share them with you with, because these are generated with a with a Mac, and I from time to time Powerpointed Mac makes

178
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.010
Diego Lopez: funny things.

179
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.670
Diego Lopez: I'll I'll share with you a new version, because because, apart from this.

180
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.660
Diego Lopez: I was discussing with a colleague that was

181
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:59.562
Diego Lopez: telling me that probably using level of assurance as a as a term in general could be misleading, because this is a very, very much

182
00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:11.909
Diego Lopez: a term that is very much associated with digital identity and authentication, etcetera, and probably is gonna be misleading. I am want to change slides

183
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:21.210
Diego Lopez: a little bit. If you allow me. I mean I will do it today or tomorrow morning and share with them with you. Luigi.

184
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:21.830
Luigi Iannone: True.

185
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:31.449
Diego Lopez: If you see if you see any problem with them or with the with the especially with the pick, the figures I can the figures? I'm not. I mean just to

186
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:54.620
Diego Lopez: to fill the gap or to have an illustration. What we are talking about, not not necessarily that essential. If we see at the end they are serious problems, we can forget about them. But but anyway, let me let me to go through it through them and change a little bit, and start talking about level, of comply, of compliance that are related to level of assurance, etc, etc.

187
00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:14.599
Diego Lopez: So bring the the story in a different in a different way. That is a little bit less depending on the, on the concept, because might be that there are some identity freak in the room that will start objecting out this. And this is something that I guess that this is precisely the kind of thing that we want to avoid.

188
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.989
Luigi Iannone: Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine.

189
00:32:19.011 --> 00:32:25.109
Diego Lopez: And, by the way, something something that I notice when when looking at the final agenda.

190
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:33.800
Diego Lopez: is that the very likely I will have to leave the room by the before the end of the meeting, because I will have to present at another

191
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.809
Diego Lopez: meeting that is in parallel.

192
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:43.399
Diego Lopez: But the well, that's something that we I had to ask the chair of the other group to be at the at the at the end of the of the session.

193
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.130
Luigi Iannone: So we are on Tuesday morning.

194
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:56.280
Diego Lopez: Yeah, Tuesday morning, and I have to to present a new version of the draft at the Qrg.

195
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.220
Luigi Iannone: Oh, okay, yeah. Quantity.

196
00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:00.570
Diego Lopez: Okay.

197
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:13.030
Diego Lopez: yeah, but I will. I will ask the chairs that I want to go at the end. So well. But by the by the moment I I have to leave, I hope that everything is more or less settled one way or another.

198
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:20.760
Luigi Iannone: Yeah. Well, if you go back to the agenda.

199
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.771
Luigi Iannone: so we have 2 h. But

200
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:30.150
Luigi Iannone: the the 1st part, the introduction will be 10 min, and then we go directly

201
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:37.729
Luigi Iannone: to the technical presentation. So this will be at the let's say, at the very beginning of the of the session.

202
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.389
Luigi Iannone: So

203
00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:52.200
Luigi Iannone: you should be able to present at both groups, if the chairs on the other group agree to put you toward the end of the session.

204
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:55.369
Diego Lopez: Exactly that. That's my plan, and

205
00:33:55.530 --> 00:34:07.620
Diego Lopez: and stay at least for even for the open mic, as much as I can. So so well, if there's some discussion happens so to take part in it.

206
00:34:08.015 --> 00:34:18.020
Diego Lopez: be at the very end and go rush for the other side. Tell people about what I'm doing. And and just look for for some additional. Yeah, I I think that this is something that

207
00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:24.409
Diego Lopez: did not shouldn't interfere that much in a way, you know.

208
00:34:25.483 --> 00:34:27.536
Luigi Iannone: I was thinking so.

209
00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:46.049
Luigi Iannone: we we certainly we. We have to avoid to have several speakers, all the different use cases, but we may also. Michael is not online, but he we can talk with him, and maybe he can present the architectural part of the presentation

210
00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:52.059
Luigi Iannone: so that he will be there through the open mic session and answer the

211
00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:59.279
Luigi Iannone: architectural part, and you stay as long as you can. If there are, let's say, policy based questions.

212
00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:17.579
Diego Lopez: No, no, I I research group that is, I mean, things are more relaxed than I mean the working groups in those terms. So I don't. I don't foresee any any serious conflict with this, but just I wanted you to know.

213
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:18.880
Luigi Iannone: Well, the.

214
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.569
Toerless: Architecture, pictures from the 1st buff

215
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.540
Toerless: a little bit overwhelming, so that might need some.

216
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.314
Luigi Iannone: Polishing.

217
00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.940
Luigi Iannone: Yeah.

218
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:42.300
Toerless: Yeah, well, so all these, all these, these these pictures with a lot of different boxes, right? So it's it's so easy as an architect to get obsessed about them. And

219
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.540
Toerless: it's always hard to. So, you know, try to find.

220
00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:57.109
Toerless: Yeah, I now understand. I think Michael's were were even worse. So these ones are, almost, you know, agreeable.

221
00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.250
Luigi Iannone: Agreeable.

222
00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:12.089
Toerless: Yeah, yeah. So I mean, it's it's it's always yeah. I mean, the more important stuff is really to to make sure that problematic people with problematic questions upfront have been dealt with upfront so.

223
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:13.710
Luigi Iannone: Then you can.

224
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.570
Toerless: And away with everything complex. Right? So I mean.

225
00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:27.710
Toerless: in something like quick, right? People didn't understand it either at all, or there they were all already in on the thing. Right? So that's that's the state that you need to get to.

226
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:30.098
Toerless: There is no middle ground, basically.

227
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.080
Toerless: Yes.

228
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:39.509
Luigi Iannone: I mean this slide that this time it looks looks okay. I mean, obviously.

229
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:51.850
Luigi Iannone: there is the need to be explained, because just like that it's not immediate, but that's the point where I think the the oral presentation should be fine and looks more

230
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:56.680
Luigi Iannone: structured in the first, st both

231
00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.659
Luigi Iannone: more or less. They were the same elements, but but

232
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:04.809
Luigi Iannone: too colorful and a little bit more next year, you know, since.

233
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:26.440
Toerless: You can remember 20 page versions of this, not for attestation, but for path, monitoring for all type of quality, things that that's something we did 1012 years back in Cisco, and we went back and forth with all the different alternatives you know, who initiates the orchestration. Is it done? Hop by hop. Is it collected, is it? Oh, man, yeah. So

234
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.256
Toerless: at least you've got just, you know, 2 options here, so

235
00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:42.639
Toerless: I don't believe much in in the left page, right? So that's been my experience. But that's obvious.

236
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:58.199
Luigi Iannone: Okay, to be to be debated once we are a working group. But I like this slide, because also is what we have in the document. That shows. We. We have an initial architecture

237
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.540
Luigi Iannone: so, or at least a draft of it.

238
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:08.809
Luigi Iannone: So we we are not starting for from a blank page, and we don't know exactly what to do.

239
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:16.200
Luigi Iannone: So we have a clear idea on how to tackle the use cases that are presented in the 1st part of the slide.

240
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:28.779
Toerless: Do you do? You have Slide? That that shows kind of how you may have a lot of the infrastructure already from from Reds, except that it's not

241
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:36.840
Toerless: being used to do things that is coupled to the forwarding plane, but just to the device properties.

242
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:44.680
Luigi Iannone: There is a discussion about oh.

243
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:59.569
Toerless: I mean, if I look at that picture right, I would say that the whole Yang stuff the collection right? So the modules in the notes. A lot of that you may already have from from rats. So then the path verifier is new.

244
00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:06.689
Toerless: In the boxes down there in the attestor. The the connection to the forwarding plane is new.

245
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:17.029
Toerless: right, but but the middle infrastructure, right? So the orchestrator, for example, especially on the left hand picture right, so that may already be be able to get from rats.

246
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:23.220
Luigi Iannone: Oh, oh, okay, okay. So somehow, highlight, which box is.

247
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:27.449
Toerless: So this is this is this is about eating our own ietf dog food

248
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:43.069
Toerless: right? Even if you're not, I would say that that would be a sales pitch, especially for the people who do not understand rats, but that it's about actually leveraging rats to do something useful, you know, beyond the scope of work rats can do.

249
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:58.550
Luigi Iannone: Okay, okay? So so somehow, highlight, the the boxes that are already defined somehow in rats and the boxes that instead are explicitly added by.

250
00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:18.089
Toerless: I mean, that's that's 1 possible way. Right? So the whole thing is, sales pitch right in terms of this is not all ground shield. New right? All the, you know. Difficult attestation, you know, cryptography and a lot of infrastructure components between network devices and a back end

251
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:23.050
Toerless: have been defined by reds. So we're a Reds application.

252
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.330
Toerless: And we're coupling right? So so so that type of type of sales pitch.

253
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.109
Luigi Iannone: And then.

254
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:34.679
Toerless: The details. You know a lot better than I, right? But I'm just saying that.

255
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:42.320
Toerless: But whatever we can do to to give people an easy, high, level understanding why they could like it.

256
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.040
Luigi Iannone: Okay, okay, see your point?

257
00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.150
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, I can work on that.

258
00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:58.029
Meiling Chen: That's the sorry I still don't know. Rats is any of you folks in Reds.

259
00:40:59.697 --> 00:41:02.960
Luigi Iannone: I'm following the mailing list and the discussions.

260
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.010
Diego Lopez: Yeah.

261
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.700
Peter Chunchi Liu: I'm following me, too, I think.

262
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:13.509
Toerless: Do we have an actual Reds person on the agenda to kind of make that pitch? Or do we have to make it.

263
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:22.810
Luigi Iannone: I would say we have to make it. But as we discussed last time, we will share these slides, all the slides with him

264
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:44.199
Luigi Iannone: beforehand, so to make sure that he's in the room, and can give the rats viewpoint and support, let's say. And Nancy. He she was the the previous rats co-chair, so she also, I would say, a rats expert.

265
00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:48.630
Toerless: Yeah.

266
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.979
Toerless: Yeah. So I

267
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:59.419
Toerless: I'm just saying, there's always there's always I haven't looked at at your timeline for for the buff. You know how much time you have for stuff. But.

268
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.770
Luigi Iannone: Oh, I can show you.

269
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:10.829
Toerless: No, no, I'm saying whether or not it would make sense for a red person to ask a red person for 5 min of reds or something.

270
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.780
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

271
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:22.950
Toerless: Even you could even prepare the red slide for that person. But you know

272
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.133
Toerless: I'm I'm I'm just brainstorming right? So if it doesn't fit. Don't bother so it's

273
00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.180
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

274
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.720
Peter Chunchi Liu: Like rats. State of art, that kind of thing.

275
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:45.410
Luigi Iannone: I wouldn't do it explicitly on the agenda, let's say, because otherwise someone can quickly say, Oh, go.

276
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.979
Luigi Iannone: do the working rats directly. Okay, and we will have to spend the time to

277
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.009
Luigi Iannone: why, it's different. Why, we need something different.

278
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:57.200
Toerless: Wait a second we want to be in. Are we also in security.

279
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.710
Luigi Iannone: We are in security. Yes.

280
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.700
Toerless: Also targeting security. Okay.

281
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:10.100
Luigi Iannone: But well at the end the Isg did this decision. Obviously we are in between routing and security.

282
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:11.340
Toerless: Right.

283
00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.110
Luigi Iannone: No, no.

284
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:21.259
Toerless: That's that's a that's a good counterpoint, right? So that we we want to create sufficient distance not to be

285
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:33.199
Toerless: asked to to work in rats. So that's that's that's the counterpoint. So what's what's your counterpoint answer? When when people come and say, Why, why doesn't this go into rats proper?

286
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.780
Toerless: Why does this need to be a separate working group.

287
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:47.830
Luigi Iannone: Because in there are 2 points in the last there is no notion of path, and there is no way to put the proof of transit

288
00:43:48.410 --> 00:44:05.880
Luigi Iannone: into rats, because rats is about attestation, and it's not about forwarding or stuff like that. So that is why we need something else. And we we can absolutely use as much as we can about rats, but would make sense to have

289
00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.609
Luigi Iannone: related working groups, but different.

290
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.880
Luigi Iannone: So to focus each other on the on, the on the specificities of their solution.

291
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:30.190
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, adding to Luigi's point one you know, also rest. Focus on, you know, like single device attestation like a single system. But they, you know. But now we are focusing on network deployments.

292
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.320
Peter Chunchi Liu: Right? I think that's a major, you know, extension of scope.

293
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.100
Toerless: So ultimately, it's it's a

294
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:48.159
Toerless: network service attestation through the forwarding plane, because that's ultimately the only thing you can trust.

295
00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:50.620
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah.

296
00:44:55.350 --> 00:45:02.190
Toerless: Yeah. So so are you happy to to get to, to go into security? Was that ever discussed, or

297
00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:05.980
Toerless: in terms of? Would you rather like to be in routing or.

298
00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:13.831
Diego Lopez: My my impression is that has been discussed a lot lately. We were talking with the origins we were talking with

299
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.420
Diego Lopez: routing Avs, etcetera. And they were.

300
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:24.846
Diego Lopez: I mean, they recommended us to go through security. That's what that was my impression, because,

301
00:45:25.642 --> 00:45:43.429
Diego Lopez: that, the the problem is is they didn't perceive this as a routing problem. It's a it's an application of security techniques to routing. They prefer it to be in route inside and security that that was my impression from the from from the almost from the very beginning.

302
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.960
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, that's right.

303
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:59.639
Diego Lopez: But, by the way, Luigi, there are a few people from from the rats environment that probably could. For example, Thomas, apart from him.

304
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:17.909
Diego Lopez: Ned and Roy there. There are 3 people that probably would be good to have there, though I must say Roy is a little bit skeptical, or it was a little bit skeptical about this.

305
00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:26.480
Diego Lopez: He had the view that this was to overload the network with a particular functionality he don't like.

306
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:39.049
Diego Lopez: but I don't know. I if Hank is not available, or if we want someone in addition, we we can. We can talk with. We can talk with Thomas, for example, during the the 1st

307
00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:44.049
Diego Lopez: and this guy I'm trying to remember he's a he works for the

308
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:49.499
Diego Lopez: is that the chair, or is right now the co-chair of the group he's working for Intel

309
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:53.180
Diego Lopez: with that white moustache, Ned. It's Ned.

310
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:54.400
Peter Chunchi Liu: Smith.

311
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.479
Diego Lopez: Nice to meet you.

312
00:46:55.897 --> 00:46:57.700
Diego Lopez: Okay, he's a way. It was.

313
00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.820
Peter Chunchi Liu: So supportive.

314
00:46:59.993 --> 00:47:04.600
Diego Lopez: That could be another-, another-, another potential rat supporter. So to say.

315
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:09.930
Diego Lopez: yeah.

316
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:32.739
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, I think I think that's sufficient. And maybe we should leave some time for the use case, because I think some, you know, mailing, and the other.

317
00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:39.350
Peter Chunchi Liu: you know, from China. Unicom also, you know, want to work on the use case. And I, you know.

318
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:52.680
Peter Chunchi Liu: really think the use case should be like very iconic one. So everyone, when when they talk about Nasr, they should have one use case pop up to their mind, and you know, rather than you know, going everywhere.

319
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:07.380
Peter Chunchi Liu: So shall we, you know. Take a look at the those use cases. And you know, yeah.

320
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:13.110
Peter Chunchi Liu: and discuss if you know these should be, you know, consolidated into to, you know

321
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.740
Peter Chunchi Liu: together, or should be presented separately.

322
00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.810
Luigi Iannone: So between this one and this one.

323
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:31.589
Luigi Iannone: Are you looking at my personal opinion that we is good to have the, the.

324
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:37.109
Luigi Iannone: the different use cases on the slides. We don't necessarily need to go in.

325
00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:40.650
Peter Chunchi Liu: Much details on each use case.

326
00:48:41.199 --> 00:48:46.370
Luigi Iannone: My personal opinion is nice to have the the policy aspects at the beginning.

327
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.330
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

328
00:48:47.680 --> 00:49:05.399
Luigi Iannone: main example could be this, one could be another one, then we can drop this slide. It depends how Diego do. You will present and depends on how you feel. The important thing is to give a clear idea of the let's say, overall use case.

329
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:21.129
Luigi Iannone: and then we we can show the the other slides. To say, China is interested in this China. Mobile is interested in this other use case without necessarily spending

330
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:31.239
Luigi Iannone: too much time on the detailed use cases just to show that there there are a few. Okay? And then we go to the architectural part.

331
00:49:32.286 --> 00:49:44.233
Diego Lopez: Yeah, I'm having having some people in the room. If we are going to have a mailing, and then we will be there. So if they are asked about the particular details they can, they can talk about it.

332
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.870
Luigi Iannone: Absolutely they can answer on the, on the specific questions related to

333
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.459
Luigi Iannone: with the specific use case absolutely, absolutely.

334
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:59.860
Diego Lopez: One thing that came to my mind looking at the China Unicorn one is that it reminds me very much of

335
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.679
Diego Lopez: some discussions we have had with network. Licen.

336
00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.120
Diego Lopez: It is something that I'm not going to, I don't believe is the

337
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:15.580
Diego Lopez: we need to to open the net or slicing can of worms, but simply simply that. That reminded me very much. This.

338
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:24.789
Diego Lopez: probably in the in the long term. Probably we could talk about this because you know that there is an ongoing working. It is the

339
00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:33.357
Diego Lopez: In in one of the working groups people are working on address license, though there are, you know, the usual

340
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:47.979
Diego Lopez: controversy about whether network slicing belongs to the Atf or not, but this looks very much as a way of assuring that the slice is being properly used.

341
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:53.059
Diego Lopez: But that's another story. Probably we should not open that that there, during the ball.

342
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.860
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, I agree.

343
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:57.560
Meiling Chen: Yeah.

344
00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:02.950
Meiling Chen: So so other use cases should tell one story.

345
00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:25.289
Meiling Chen: and I think the use case should not be should not have too too much details.

346
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:31.840
Meiling Chen: We cannot make the listeners confused about this 3 use case.

347
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.300
Meiling Chen: So we need to be simplified.

348
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:53.269
Luigi Iannone: I agree. I mean, we can keep the slide with the, with the details of the use cases just to show there is a main use case. And then this can be

349
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.309
Luigi Iannone: the client in different ways. Okay.

350
00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:09.395
Luigi Iannone: but without spending really too much time on on the use cases. All the use cases, I mean, especially because

351
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:15.630
Luigi Iannone: So in principle, we have 35 min

352
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:20.770
Luigi Iannone: for the use cases and problem statement.

353
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:45.599
Luigi Iannone: So this, this goes fast. I mean, it's 15 min each. Let's say so. We we we don't have time to go into details, and we should avoid to to spend too much time the the use cases. Otherwise we don't have time to give a clear idea of the architecture, because to explain a slide

354
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:49.039
Luigi Iannone: like this one.

355
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:52.210
Luigi Iannone: Yes, we. We need a bit of time.

356
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.150
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah.

357
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.980
Luigi Iannone: So we let's say that in terms of number of slides

358
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:10.989
Luigi Iannone: we are good, but we don't have to overdo it with too many slides, especially in the 1st part.

359
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:36.469
Meiling Chen: The architecture. Step one, I mean the before use architecture. The new role

360
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:45.419
Meiling Chen: pass verify is not a neural, but pass is the new function. So we, we, we have to highlight that.

361
00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.880
Peter Chunchi Liu: No, that's a that's a detail.

362
00:53:50.680 --> 00:54:06.250
Peter Chunchi Liu: because Verifiers also is already, you know, a role in the rats. Maybe there should be multiple verifiers. Maybe there should be like something, but it does not behave significantly different. But the orchestrator is definitely a new role. So

363
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.329
Peter Chunchi Liu: I don't know if that answers your question.

364
00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.389
Meiling Chen: Okay, okay. The password file is borrowed from rest. Totally right?

365
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.480
Peter Chunchi Liu: More or less.

366
00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:30.569
Peter Chunchi Liu: Does this pick, you know? Does this page generally make sense to everyone?

367
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:36.420
Peter Chunchi Liu: I tried to make it, you know, you know, simple to to.

368
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:48.730
Peter Chunchi Liu: to comprehend, like the 3 steps, like a truce setup, verify very similar to the, you know, the measured boot in the trusted computing group like Tcg thing.

369
00:54:50.900 --> 00:55:16.100
Peter Chunchi Liu: I think you know, if Tcg people are generally like people who understand about measured boot or kind of other trustworthiness technologies, they should understand like this is very similar to that process where we, you know, have a measured boot and establish the baseline, and then, during the use we continuously, you know, verify the status against the baseline.

370
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:26.260
Toerless: Right. But why? I mean so in AI we call the 1st step learning the second inference. Right? So what what are these steps called here?

371
00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:35.769
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, yeah, just like that, like the 1st step is set up. I call a setup, and then the the second step is verified

372
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:37.530
Peter Chunchi Liu: right? The 1st step.

373
00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.480
Toerless: Right, but it's not on the slide.

374
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.060
Peter Chunchi Liu: Sorry.

375
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.250
Diego Lopez: I, in the.

376
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:58.360
Toerless: So I'm saying, I'm saying it's not very clear that the step one happens once during, you know, service definition and step 2 happens for every packet, for example, or flow, or period of time, or whatever the unit of of execution is.

377
00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:18.811
Diego Lopez: In the yeah. That's something that we we should align. I think it would be interesting to to align terminology, because I don't remember the names I gave it in the on the slides, on the use case slides, and the policy because let me check. I was talking about.

378
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:27.650
Toerless: The name would be great if people recognized the name. Otherwise, you know, instead of saying Yang example

379
00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:30.499
Toerless: put under step one, you know.

380
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:36.709
Toerless: you know, during once during service, bring up just an explanation under the step right.

381
00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:39.600
Luigi Iannone: Like pass attestation or pass setup.

382
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:39.920
Diego Lopez: Is.

383
00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.229
Luigi Iannone: Attestation there is.

384
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:58.130
Toerless: Set up. Yeah, whatever whatever you wanna do, the explanation right? But make it clear. 1 1 is, you know, complex, but happens once and 2 is the big challenge for us, because that needs to happen ideally for every packet. So we need to really make it fly.

385
00:56:59.721 --> 00:57:09.129
Diego Lopez: What I'm using is, I mean in the the second in the second slide that is using is the attestation of the path components

386
00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:15.629
Diego Lopez: that are done with when constructing the path, and the second step is about the decision of the path behavior.

387
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:26.780
Diego Lopez: I am. I'm totally happy if we we use a different terms, but it would be interesting just to align them. Because these are these 2 steps.

388
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:32.130
Diego Lopez: One is so past components where you where you build

389
00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:35.390
Diego Lopez: path behavior while you use the path.

390
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:36.580
Diego Lopez: Yeah.

391
00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:44.080
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, yeah, I can change the wording. Sorry you suggested that it's called the path behavior. Right?

392
00:57:44.446 --> 00:57:51.770
Diego Lopez: Have a look at the at the second, at the second of my slides. It was saying in the

393
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:57.269
Diego Lopez: it's just that we align it, because if we are, we are talking about this.

394
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:58.420
Peter Chunchi Liu: Oh, right? Right? Right? Yes.

395
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:03.909
Diego Lopez: System that we talk about. And again, I'm not that I

396
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:11.830
Diego Lopez: I believe that they are already, that they are the best wordings. If turtles have a better one. I'm more than happy.

397
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:20.330
Peter Chunchi Liu: No, no, I think it makes sense. We. We should align for people to understand. I will align with the this. This page.

398
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:27.719
Toerless: I would just make bad jokes like we now have to call everything in AI terms. Learning and inference.

399
00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.982
Diego Lopez: So, no, that's it.

400
00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.690
Peter Chunchi Liu: That's another way to turn.

401
00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:38.930
Toerless: No, it's not too bad a joke right, because it's not too bad, but I don't think.

402
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:54.389
Diego Lopez: No, but but this is not about. I think it's a good analogy, you say. Well, this is similar to, or if you think in AI terms as as we are. We all do in these days, something like that, something that I would not put in written. But it's a is a very good analogy.

403
00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:59.610
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, yeah.

404
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:11.210
Luigi Iannone: I tend to to say that instead of past behavior, maybe past compliance, because this is what we we try to do so to.

405
00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:16.730
Luigi Iannone: that is compliant with a certain set of requirements.

406
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:21.039
Diego Lopez: That's a that's good. Yes.

407
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.900
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah.

408
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.949
Toerless: We're not going

409
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:34.569
Toerless: cases like, you know, errors in the network. Rerouting path changes, and we go through the whole thing, maybe, or we do it upfront or so.

410
00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.360
Toerless: It's a.

411
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.590
Peter Chunchi Liu: Well.

412
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:48.679
Peter Chunchi Liu: I think in charter we mentioned like we will start with a single path. So you know there will not

413
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:52.699
Peter Chunchi Liu: any, you know. Complex things like that. I think.

414
01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:15.855
Toerless: So the explanation would also be that in the 1st step you typically would have a service that

415
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:19.010
Toerless: establishes a fixed path.

416
01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.330
Peter Chunchi Liu: And then

417
01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:31.910
Peter Chunchi Liu: well, in a charter. Yes, but you know fixed path will bring up some brittleness or some other questions.

418
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:40.350
Toerless: So you're trying to avoid going into that level of detail.

419
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:53.799
Peter Chunchi Liu: A little bit. Yeah. And you know, yeah, just trying to make this minimally usable. You know, for people to understand. Okay, this is, although this is very simple, it it's doable.

420
01:00:54.190 --> 01:01:03.999
Peter Chunchi Liu: So I tried to. So so that's why I think we put it in the charter, but not, you know, emphasize that in the presentation. I don't know if that makes sense.

421
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:16.139
Luigi Iannone: There is also a question. I mean, if you attest a pass. So you have attestation of several bases and the pass changes. Let's say the operator.

422
01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.300
Luigi Iannone: the routing system. Whoever tells you

423
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.139
Luigi Iannone: the password changed it. This is the new one.

424
01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:35.489
Luigi Iannone: Then you don't need necessarily to re attest the whole path, but just the the notes that change it. Maybe it's always you have an incremental step.

425
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.770
Luigi Iannone: But you you I don't think we need to go

426
01:01:41.950 --> 01:02:01.269
Luigi Iannone: into this kind of details. If anybody raises the questions that we are, yeah, this is something we have to to work on. And we have the incremental verification, or something like that as a possible approach.

427
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.400
Luigi Iannone: Yeah.

428
01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:09.980
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah.

429
01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:16.150
Toerless: Think the time is running out. So Ca-, can we go to the problem statement? Page.

430
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:28.080
Peter Chunchi Liu: Because you know no from page 10. So I don't know if everyone yeah.

431
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:28.399
Luigi Iannone: This one.

432
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.550
Peter Chunchi Liu: Just part. Yeah, I don't know if it makes sense for everyone.

433
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.870
Peter Chunchi Liu: So okay.

434
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:42.700
Peter Chunchi Liu: yeah, I try to write the problem statement in a more, you know, open-minded in a way of thinking this

435
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:55.260
Peter Chunchi Liu: like, why do we need Nazar like, and why do we do it now? And what what should be look like. I don't know if this play this page makes sense like.

436
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:58.379
Peter Chunchi Liu: why not so right now? I kind of to write

437
01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:14.170
Peter Chunchi Liu: because the client of the, you know, connectivity service. They cannot choose geolocation, you know, compliance requirements. They cannot, you know, you know. Basically, we'll see in the charter, you know, choose those security requirements

438
01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.070
Peter Chunchi Liu: and operators and clients don't have such tool to to do that.

439
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:20.613
Luigi Iannone: So

440
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:30.340
Luigi Iannone: my personal opinion, I I find the slide nice. I always just avoid using the term client, because to to

441
01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:32.659
Luigi Iannone: to avoid confusion with with.

442
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.309
Peter Chunchi Liu: Web client. Something like that.

443
01:03:35.827 --> 01:03:38.930
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, right? I forgot that. Yes.

444
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:54.609
Luigi Iannone: To be honest, what I would find nice is something like that. You have this slide, and right away you have something like this, which is a a clear application of what you just said. Okay.

445
01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:57.340
Toerless: Go back to the to the slide. Sorry I was just.

446
01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:57.900
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

447
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.790
Toerless: So

448
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:09.819
Toerless: do you have for all of the points a left to right equivalency.

449
01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:16.750
Toerless: because then maybe you want to change it to a table, you know, control which geolocation.

450
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.500
Peter Chunchi Liu: Well.

451
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:25.380
Toerless: The traffic, so that that is the one to one relationship. Right? So so if this was a table with 2 columns.

452
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:30.160
Toerless: and the 1st column said, you know, cannot control

453
01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.160
Toerless: which geolocation of the traffic transits, you know, can control. Right? So

454
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:48.300
Toerless: is it for the others as well. Right so means to provide enhanced service and assurance, deterministic forwarding

455
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:53.729
Toerless: more secure crap clients implicitly trust.

456
01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:59.660
Toerless: Yeah. So, except for the visibility you are trying to, to, you know.

457
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.320
Toerless: Say what you have in before and what you have afterwards, and I don't think

458
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:12.170
Toerless: the current formatting makes it very clear. This this relationship from where you are kind of on a point by point basis, right?

459
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:18.780
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, if a table is more clear, I can change it to a table.

460
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:24.720
Toerless: Yeah, maybe so. I'm just. I'm just trying to look at it. Right? So quest.

461
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.759
Toerless: So the visibility is is is new. That's fine.

462
01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:38.380
Toerless: Implicitly trust the connection more secure and carefree, compliant connectivity.

463
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:47.750
Toerless: So if you're going from implicit trust to, you know, automatically.

464
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:50.940
Peter Chunchi Liu: The verifiability. And you know, automate, yeah.

465
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:58.580
Toerless: But I think the the whole point, the carefree, compliant connectivity is,

466
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:08.629
Toerless: yeah, yeah, this this wording is is is, I mean, these are all excellent points. It's just.

467
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:12.980
Toerless: you know, a good exercise to try to make it as crisp as possible.

468
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:17.819
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, I think carefree here means visibility and verifiability.

469
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:22.780
Toerless: Yeah. But the whole point is that carefree means that

470
01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:28.520
Toerless: you don't have to come up with a an elaborate

471
01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:35.970
Toerless: additional labor verification process. But it's a fully automated verification, right.

472
01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.650
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah.

473
01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:40.120
Toerless: So 1st of all, you cannot trust today.

474
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.370
Toerless: And if you had to trust today with today's mechanisms, it would be a lot of work.

475
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.409
Toerless: And this solution automates this all

476
01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:59.890
Toerless: right, it does verification, and it fully automates it. So that's that's a good before and after. So that's that's the on the right hand side, the 4th bullet point

477
01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:05.929
Toerless: enhanced services. I'm not quite sure.

478
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.839
Toerless: If that's actually true.

479
01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.750
Toerless: maybe maybe I'm I'm a little bit too picky again. Right so. But how does NASA

480
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.960
Toerless: help you to to get to deterministic forwarding.

481
01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:40.529
Peter Chunchi Liu: Well, you you kind of verify if it's you know. Sorry, I just wanna say it again. So determine forwarding. If we have, you know, if we pick only the, you know, secure boot or integrity check devices.

482
01:07:40.570 --> 01:08:04.500
Peter Chunchi Liu: And we we kind of have this path behavior attested. Then there should be like. No, you know, backdoors or or vulnerabilities, and just in all, each individual device, forwarding behavior should be deterministic, and when you only, you know, choose them to, you know, provide a connected

483
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:10.679
Peter Chunchi Liu: connect to the service, and then the service in all should be deterministic.

484
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:19.799
Toerless: Okay. But wait a second. So deterministic in the Ietf would most likely be read as what the deterministic working group does.

485
01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:26.089
Luigi Iannone: Definite. It can be me misleading. The so would be better to find an order.

486
01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:27.250
Luigi Iannone: Yes, another word.

487
01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:29.689
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, that's that's a, yeah.

488
01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:31.800
Luigi Iannone: One.

489
01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.550
Peter Chunchi Liu: That's right.

490
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.006
Peter Chunchi Liu: It's just I kind of presented this

491
01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:48.689
Peter Chunchi Liu: so sorry. It's just. I kind of presented this deterministic behavior concept to what is that called one of the chairs in the Idr Working group, and he likes it very much. So

492
01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:54.259
Peter Chunchi Liu: it should be a good concept. But a, you know different wording should be, should be good.

493
01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:58.760
Luigi Iannone: Be accountable for wording, or something like that.

494
01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:02.629
Peter Chunchi Liu: So so sorry! What accountable for me? Accountable!

495
01:09:02.982 --> 01:09:12.137
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, so that you you at the end of the day, you can verify whether or not the forwarding has been done in a deterministic way.

496
01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:16.390
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, it's just I think it's.

497
01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:24.549
Toerless: It's it's the so on the left hand side. It's really no assurance for service properties.

498
01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:29.489
Toerless: And here you have assurance through attestation.

499
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:32.710
Luigi Iannone: True, right.

500
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.559
Toerless: Right. So I think that's the that's the before and after.

501
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.100
Peter Chunchi Liu: That's a good way. This is. This is.

502
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:49.669
Toerless: All about assurance, you know, service assurance. Right? So now we we don't have service assurance, and then we're doing service assurance through attestation, cryptographic attestation.

503
01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:51.700
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yep. Yeah.

504
01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:58.390
Toerless: Basically, the word cryptographic in there will secure your place in the security area. So.

505
01:10:00.145 --> 01:10:01.999
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, that's a that's a good rule.

506
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:02.849
Peter Chunchi Liu: We'll call you Ashley.

507
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:10.810
Toerless: So then the new traffic left.

508
01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:13.289
Toerless: Request that reverse devices

509
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:26.360
Toerless: terrific, perfect. So detour unauthorized.

510
01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:40.230
Toerless: Yeah, maybe maybe the

511
01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:48.520
Toerless: maybe all these these small bullet points on. You know the traffic leakage is is for the left hand side, right. So

512
01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:55.939
Toerless: you know, traffic leakage causing security and service.

513
01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:56.440
Peter Chunchi Liu: Second.

514
01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.270
Toerless: Problems.

515
01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:05.710
Toerless: Then on the right hand side is all leakage will be discovered and discarded and alerted.

516
01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:12.090
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, yeah.

517
01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:22.790
Toerless: But yeah, I mean you. So it really depends, right? So how much time you want to spend on this. But yeah, I think it. It is a. It is a cool thing to to try to work this out as good as possible.

518
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:28.235
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, yeah, I'll fix it asap.

519
01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:36.930
Toerless: No, no, I mean, I have been too long around product management people. So please excuse me.

520
01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:45.739
Peter Chunchi Liu: No, no, I mean it should be. It's about time that for for previews, right, we have a preview upcoming for relevant peoples. So

521
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:49.869
Peter Chunchi Liu: I'll fix very quick.

522
01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:10.429
Peter Chunchi Liu: Okay, if that makes sense, you know. Maybe next I think there's another another page about, why do we do, Nasr? Now?

523
01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.949
Peter Chunchi Liu: I think so I think it's a 12,

524
01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:16.870
Peter Chunchi Liu: because I make, you know 4 reasons to that.

525
01:12:17.514 --> 01:12:34.929
Peter Chunchi Liu: I don't know if it makes sense like number one, because it's rats. Our, you know, foundational technology is ready in our core products. I think Cisco have a products that supports rats. Us already have a core products that supports rats.

526
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:49.259
Peter Chunchi Liu: and the second one is that we allow, you know, some kind of a secure distinction, and you know, differentiated or security enhanced services because we can choose, we can orchestrate to verify.

527
01:12:49.970 --> 01:13:02.610
Peter Chunchi Liu: And the 3rd one is, you know, behavioral assurance, like, I think, the the past behavior, the ones Diego mentioned. I will align with their words. But you know, that's basically what I'm trying to say.

528
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:05.760
Peter Chunchi Liu: You have path behavioral assurance.

529
01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:29.949
Toerless: If you're too much worried, if if this this goes fully into this stuff of of red. So if you're worried about getting into 2 reds. Then maybe, you know, remove reds and replace it by. You know, attestation, technology, attestation technology. Right? So say, in the beginning, rats, you know.

530
01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:34.529
Luigi Iannone: That's a good point. We we have several.

531
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:37.860
Toerless: Or or attestation, technologies.

532
01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:41.830
Peter Chunchi Liu: Right? And so now we're driving attestation technologies. Further.

533
01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:46.529
Toerless: If you want to say less red, just not to become a rat yourself.

534
01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.400
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yes, yes, that's right.

535
01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.179
Diego Lopez: So that's what we'll do.

536
01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.859
Diego Lopez: Yeah, very good.

537
01:13:52.503 --> 01:13:53.790
Peter Chunchi Liu: Noted. Yeah.

538
01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.960
Meiling Chen: Yeah, and basically, yeah.

539
01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:13.369
Peter Chunchi Liu: You know, you know, basically, the the choose orchestrate verify is is NASA.

540
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.490
Toerless: And again deterministic forwarding.

541
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.670
Toerless: Let's let's replace deterministic with something.

542
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.360
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, how about just accountable forwarding

543
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.119
Peter Chunchi Liu: good for you?

544
01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.395
Toerless: Another? A what was the other? A word?

545
01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:39.910
Peter Chunchi Liu: Auditable, no.

546
01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:44.674
Toerless: Too late! Here. Sorry.

547
01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:48.690
Peter Chunchi Liu: Would appreciate your.

548
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:54.379
Luigi Iannone: How we can choose a different term later on. If we we find out.

549
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:54.989
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, yeah, sure.

550
01:14:54.990 --> 01:15:02.079
Luigi Iannone: it's just one word. Let's let's go for accountable forwarding for now, maybe what's missing later on.

551
01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:07.980
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, I'll start a thread for for this thing.

552
01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.290
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah. But I think in general, the the

553
01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:14.690
Peter Chunchi Liu: these bullets are okay in general, right?

554
01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:18.029
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

555
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.580
Luigi Iannone: Okay, we are slightly over time.

556
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:31.379
Peter Chunchi Liu: Were sufficiently discussed.

557
01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:48.989
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, I I think we are on the good path. We discussed. What is the the remaining steps to to finalize these slides? Everything looks on track, and we don't have any more interim meetings.

558
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.399
Luigi Iannone: I don't need to wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning.

559
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.669
Diego Lopez: Before 5 yes.

560
01:15:57.046 --> 01:16:12.109
Luigi Iannone: No, but I mean we we I think we did a good job during the various interim meetings. We we just need to finalize the the slides and we are ready. We, we are scheduled on in Bangkok. So

561
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:18.969
Luigi Iannone: we are good. We we can do this the last mile through emails. And yeah.

562
01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.110
Peter Chunchi Liu: So.

563
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:30.789
Diego Lopez: Yeah. And and we and we can. We can have a catch up. I mean, I will arrive. I will arrive. Personally, I will arrive in Bangkok at so on Friday evening.

564
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:40.149
Diego Lopez: so I guess that you will be around during the hackathon, or or on Monday or Sunday Sunday evening. We we can have a

565
01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.720
Diego Lopez: a catch up just in case we need.

566
01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:46.840
Toerless: Okay, and you won't have the the routing people bitch bitch to you.

567
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:51.909
Toerless: because it's same as as link state routing. So

568
01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.465
Toerless: the call routing people are all.

569
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:56.520
Diego Lopez: Yeah.

570
01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:58.720
Toerless: Good.

571
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.920
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah.

572
01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.379
Diego Lopez: Very good.

573
01:17:01.776 --> 01:17:11.279
Luigi Iannone: Would be a good idea if we we can catch up together Sunday or Monday, I mean, I will arrive on Saturday in Baku.

574
01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:12.720
Luigi Iannone: Okay?

575
01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.090
Luigi Iannone: So maybe some. Sometime on Sunday.

576
01:17:16.985 --> 01:17:18.489
Diego Lopez: Yeah, freza will be.

577
01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:19.050
Peter Chunchi Liu: Together.

578
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:29.129
Diego Lopez: I will be tied, I I will be tied to a to a table during the hackathon, so if you want to look for me it will be there, and in the afternoon, you know, there is a reception, so we'll have to.

579
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:31.530
Luigi Iannone: We will find you. Diego.

580
01:17:32.419 --> 01:17:37.510
Diego Lopez: Know it's and difficult to hide. I know that.

581
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.939
Luigi Iannone: No, no, that's.

582
01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.960
Peter Chunchi Liu: I'll be the heck.

583
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.440
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, yeah.

584
01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.490
Peter Chunchi Liu: Yeah, I'll be there, too.

585
01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:46.910
Diego Lopez: Very good.

586
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.580
Diego Lopez: So I think I'm gonna grab something for breakfast.

587
01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:55.840
Luigi Iannone: Okay, so thank you very much.

588
01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.809
Luigi Iannone: everybody, and see you in Bangkok.

589
01:17:59.240 --> 01:17:59.570
Meiling Chen: See.

590
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.930
Diego Lopez: Okay.

591
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:00.510
Toerless: 5. Volts.

592
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:03.090
Diego Lopez: The flag.

593
01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:05.350
Toerless: Are you there.
