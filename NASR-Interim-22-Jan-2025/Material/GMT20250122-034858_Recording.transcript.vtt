00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.350
Michael Richardson: Hello!

2
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.070
Luigi Iannone: Hello!

3
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.529
Nancy: Good evening, good morning, good afternoon.

4
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.879
Michael Richardson: It is indeed one of those.

5
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.000
Nancy: I think we have one of every.

6
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.949
Luigi Iannone: Shall we start?

7
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.600
Luigi Iannone: Can you hear me?

8
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.010
Nancy: Yeah, I think

9
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:03.850
Nancy: we can. I mean the reason why I raised changing the time as I worried Luigi. We

10
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.089
Nancy: we don't have a whole lot of people on the call.

11
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.309
Luigi Iannone: But that because I think we have.

12
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.190
Nancy: The most vocal ones.

13
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.349
Luigi Iannone: I think so.

14
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:21.480
Nancy: Yeah, and the ones doing the the the workload. So, yeah.

15
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.039
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, yeah, I think so. So we we can start in a certain way. We have a

16
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.619
Luigi Iannone: a relatively simple agenda. Why doesn't go forward here.

17
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:51.180
Luigi Iannone: So the main agenda is about agenda so 1st of all, welcome everyone. As Nancy said. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening to everyone. Anybody has comments on the last meeting please feel free to share.

18
00:14:51.970 --> 00:15:01.830
Luigi Iannone: otherwise we will go directly to talk about the next agenda in the Itf. When we have the official both. We submitted the request.

19
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.740
Luigi Iannone: So we just need to wait for the reply from the Isg.

20
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.710
Luigi Iannone: Seems no comments

21
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:26.519
Luigi Iannone: simple slide. So in in this slide on the right hand side. You see the the agenda we had in the previous boss. it was 1 20, okay.

22
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.028
Luigi Iannone: and on the left hand side is what we put

23
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:44.119
Luigi Iannone: on the both requests temporarily. I mean in the sense that this is just a a skeleton on of our agenda. But we have to discuss the details. And

24
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.639
Luigi Iannone: who will present what? And the exact sequence of item and timing.

25
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:58.129
Luigi Iannone: Okay, just as a reminder. In the previous both we

26
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.810
Luigi Iannone: we did a bit too much in terms of use cases, presentation.

27
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.750
Luigi Iannone: And at the end of the day. The the message was not that clear?

28
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:25.129
Luigi Iannone: for the audience? So we have we. We really need to be a little bit more focused this time on the agenda, and better controlled timing. I think

29
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:49.179
Luigi Iannone: so, Oops. Let me end the show actually, so that I can edit but a little bit bigger.

30
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:59.710
Luigi Iannone: So at the beginning I think we will have the usual introduction. Not well, blah blah

31
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:11.089
Luigi Iannone: The wire here to me is just going quickly through the different list of site meeting, but without any details.

32
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.589
Luigi Iannone: Preparing this slide. In the buff request we we put

33
00:17:19.193 --> 00:17:25.009
Luigi Iannone: I put the the summary of feedback received from the last buff at the beginning

34
00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:35.840
Luigi Iannone: but might be, we can think, to put it actually here.

35
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.010
Nancy: Yeah.

36
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.819
Luigi Iannone: Right before the open discussion.

37
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.020
Luigi Iannone: So so just to open the discussion.

38
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:57.080
Nancy: I think, Luigi, somewhere in the agenda I lost over this. So my apologies we actually need to discuss.

39
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:03.680
Nancy: and the mic discussion should really be on the proposed charter.

40
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.070
Luigi Iannone: Okay, so you mean, really have a a charter item.

41
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.570
Nancy: Yes.

42
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.070
Luigi Iannone: So.

43
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.879
Nancy: Summary of feedback from the last.

44
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:24.179
Nancy: Boff is good, but I don't know that we had a really

45
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:32.460
Nancy: we had a proposed charter, but we didn't get to it if I recall so.

46
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.300
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

47
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.710
Nancy: Right in here. We actually need to spend the bulk of the time

48
00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:46.249
Nancy: in providing a summary of the problem statement that leads to the charter

49
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:55.770
Nancy: before we can get into the Internet draft, meaning the importance here is to pulse from

50
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.839
Nancy: whoever shows up in the room.

51
00:19:00.647 --> 00:19:04.480
Nancy: The polls and get consensus that yes.

52
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.669
Nancy: this is work that belongs in the Ietf.

53
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.830
Nancy: and the second piece is that

54
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:17.149
Nancy: not only does it belong in the Itf. This is the scope in which

55
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.540
Nancy: the working group is going to approach. First.st

56
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:30.670
Luigi Iannone: Okay, so summary of the problem statement in charter discussion. And you, you want to put this

57
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:39.790
Luigi Iannone: before discussing the Internet draft that that did. I understood correctly.

58
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.600
Nancy: Correct.

59
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.440
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

60
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.679
Nancy: Because what what Deb is going to want to hear is

61
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.520
Nancy: the those 2 questions. And then she wants to get a sense of the room.

62
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.719
Luigi Iannone: So you meaning ask,

63
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.562
Luigi Iannone: he at the beginning, also ask about

64
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.499
Nancy: No, no, no, no, we.

65
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.379
Luigi Iannone: Oh, okay. Okay.

66
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.830
Nancy: We ask at the end.

67
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:14.839
Nancy: What I'm telling you is as the area director. Deb is going to want to listen

68
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.699
Nancy: right? To cause. That was the feedback she gave us at the end. Because, remember, we

69
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.549
Nancy: ask and pulse, and she goes. No, you guys aren't even ready.

70
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:24.950
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

71
00:20:27.234 --> 00:20:38.550
Nancy: And part of it was, we spent too much time on here the drafts and proposed solutions. Whereas we need to just get to? Does everybody understand

72
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.939
Nancy: the problem and the challenge that we want to solve?

73
00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:48.149
Nancy: Not a solution, because that's what the working group is going to do. But

74
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.920
Nancy: does everybody understand the problem statement?

75
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:57.050
Nancy: And then how we scope that into something a working group can progress.

76
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.430
Nancy: Make sense. Yeah.

77
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.599
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

78
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.400
Luigi Iannone: just wondering whether or not this we-we, he.

79
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:23.781
Luigi Iannone: Let's say the the order is the right one. Whether should be there, let's say at the beginning, before

80
00:21:26.355 --> 00:21:32.779
Luigi Iannone: before discussing the documents, or actually inverting a little bit things this.

81
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.369
Nancy: So everybody else should chime in.

82
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.499
Nancy: Michael, you've done this before.

83
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.439
Nancy: and all of the working groups that I've done and chartered.

84
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.529
Nancy: We don't talk about the drafts. We talk about the problem statement.

85
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:57.989
Nancy: I think Michael's description of architectures would be helpful.

86
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.029
Nancy: But we don't talk about drafts.

87
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:13.109
Michael Richardson: So I don't think it's a problem to mention that there are drafts that exist that are in the directions that we are thinking.

88
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:14.270
Michael Richardson: But

89
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:21.230
Michael Richardson: I don't think it's the right time. I agree with you to talk about them. The reason to talk about that they exist

90
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.939
Michael Richardson: is to simply make it clear to the audience that

91
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.209
Michael Richardson: we're not just pulling, you know, wishes out of thin air.

92
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.050
Nancy: And that's a fair statement.

93
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.450
Michael Richardson: Okay? And

94
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.669
Michael Richardson: And so yeah, what you said problem saving. So the other thing I would say is that

95
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.540
Michael Richardson: as the the work grows

96
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:53.969
Michael Richardson: or as the the what's the right word is the as the marketing effort grows. That we will get new people who arrive in a state of

97
00:22:55.018 --> 00:23:09.070
Michael Richardson: confusion. And what what's this about? And with with wide variety of wrong ideas. So we actually have to kind of quickly, and we'll get better at this. I'm sure

98
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:15.909
Michael Richardson: we do have to stop, step through it as if the people in the room are seeing this for the 1st time, but

99
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.690
Michael Richardson: bounded time.

100
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.820
Nancy: Correct.

101
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:26.119
Michael Richardson: Right? So summary problem statement chart, you know. Yeah, that's that's good. But I would make that really

102
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.920
Michael Richardson: 2 points.

103
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.839
Nancy: Yeah, there should be 2 separate bullets. Luigi.

104
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.590
Luigi Iannone: Good.

105
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:36.605
Nancy: Yeah.

106
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:44.870
Michael Richardson: And I would mention in that

107
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.579
Michael Richardson: there are documents. Put up a slide with a list of some of them.

108
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.559
Michael Richardson: Don't, don't, and then say, you know, but

109
00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:01.990
Michael Richardson: we can talk about them at the end if there's time. But our focus is on the charter discussion.

110
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.770
Michael Richardson: You know.

111
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:12.890
Michael Richardson: people can click on the links and go see the things they want to see, and then run to the mic right.

112
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:31.489
Chunchi Liu: So after the charter discussion there should be like a list of documents. But we we won't jump into it. Maybe this is another bullet point.

113
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.590
Michael Richardson: Yeah, I would put well.

114
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.229
Michael Richardson: I would put that under problem statement. But anyway.

115
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:53.140
Michael Richardson: if there are drafts which we, our charter, calls out already, as you know, starting points. I don't think we've done that.

116
00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.030
Nancy: I don't think it's been mentioned before.

117
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:06.609
Michael Richardson: Some charters are like, you know, that you will start from this document. That's the problem statement, or something like that.

118
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.409
Nancy: I'm trying to remember. The most contentious one I did was rats.

119
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:13.800
Michael Richardson: Okay.

120
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:17.699
Michael Richardson: you didn't.

121
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.109
Michael Richardson: You should have been there in 2,000 for the VPN. Boff.

122
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.650
Michael Richardson: That was a disaster.

123
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.990
Nancy: Roman lost his cool. I've never seen Roman lose his school with rats.

124
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.860
Michael Richardson: With rats. Oh, really, I don't. Don't remember that. But okay.

125
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.500
Nancy: I had to be the peacekeeper. Yeah.

126
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.270
Michael Richardson: Wow. Okay.

127
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.970
Nancy: Remember, rats had 2 contingents, and they each wanted their own separate working group.

128
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.109
Michael Richardson: I. It's all I maybe I've just blocked it all out from trauma.

129
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.989
Nancy: You must have

130
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.820
Nancy: Luckily we're not in that situation here.

131
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.699
Nancy: But I remember whether it was

132
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.699
Nancy: skim or rats, or teep, or suits

133
00:26:08.685 --> 00:26:12.409
Nancy: or mile all the ones I've shared.

134
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.160
Nancy: We spent a lot of time making sure that the problem statement was well understood.

135
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.669
Nancy: The boundaries around that problem statement.

136
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:31.359
Nancy: Well, I guess the boundaries where we shift from problem statement to working group.

137
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:37.609
Nancy: to then refining what's achievable in the 1st charter.

138
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:44.769
Nancy: And so that was something. We worked very hard, and it was very difficult,

139
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:56.699
Nancy: and rats to get the group to agree that. Yes, you may believe the scope is narrow in the initial charter, but once we start

140
00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.949
Nancy: moving forward we could recharter.

141
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:08.479
Nancy: which is what has happened, and several working groups.

142
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.410
Michael Richardson: Luigi, did we stall you?

143
00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:43.456
Luigi Iannone: No, no, no, no, no, no, absolutely not. I'm just thinking a little bit.

144
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.440
Nancy: Bulk of the time is gonna get spent in these 2. The summary and the charter.

145
00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.751
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.

146
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.150
Michael Richardson: I was trying to think.

147
00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.829
Luigi Iannone: How much time to allocate to you? Check him?

148
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.205
Luigi Iannone: Okay,

149
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:14.079
Luigi Iannone: And and whether in the problem statement, if we should.

150
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:22.990
Luigi Iannone: what to say, should we start with a with a practical use case just one main example, and then.

151
00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.740
Nancy: Give the.

152
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:30.950
Luigi Iannone: Abstract problem, statement or not. That is what I was actually.

153
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:31.530
Nancy: I mean.

154
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:32.310
Luigi Iannone: My son.

155
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:38.550
Nancy: What resonated with me. I believe Michael had a Powerpoint

156
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.570
Nancy: that showed some of the scenarios, and I think.

157
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.179
Nancy: Michael, I think you articulated some of the use cases.

158
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.220
Michael Richardson: Closed architecture, or.

159
00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:55.829
Luigi Iannone: Let me look at.

160
00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:03.120
Luigi Iannone: I think that evolved a little bit in the service model that that mailing is working on

161
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.620
Luigi Iannone: with other people.

162
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.209
Luigi Iannone: Am I right?

163
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.870
Nancy: Well.

164
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:09.650
Chunchi Liu: All right.

165
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.990
Nancy: I'm trying to give you my impressions of what resonated.

166
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.850
Luigi Iannone: Better.

167
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.330
Nancy: With some of the other chairs, and Deb.

168
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:36.379
Luigi Iannone: I actually remember what? What did stick a little bit in the in the audience was the the example that Michael gave about the luckily, man, routing, let's say so that that.

169
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.180
Michael Richardson: About the what.

170
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.260
Luigi Iannone: La Clement, the the Swiss Lake.

171
00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:55.790
Michael Richardson: Oh, yeah, yeah, right? Yeah. I think that's a good one. And I really should put that in a in a diagram in a I just said that verbally, yeah, but somebody. It would be great if someone could articulate the various legal

172
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.100
Michael Richardson: requirements that are coming down.

173
00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:03.960
Michael Richardson: And then, you know, you know we could.

174
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.169
Michael Richardson: Give that example of you know what

175
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.269
Michael Richardson: what we're you know thinking about here, right.

176
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.900
Toerless: May I chime in a little bit.

177
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:18.830
Michael Richardson: Torreleas.

178
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:19.370
Luigi Iannone: What?

179
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:20.460
Toerless: Yep.

180
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.950
Nancy: Go for a torlus.

181
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.559
Toerless: Right. So you know, I think

182
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:50.680
Toerless: these are the correct formal requirements to go through and above. I mean the the maybe less well written practical requirements that, you know Isg is looking at are, you know, much more simple right in terms of? Is there a solid and diverse enough base of authors to do the work

183
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.960
Toerless: from from different companies, right or contributors. So is that

184
00:30:57.644 --> 00:31:04.729
Toerless: is that well positioned in in one or 2 slides in in terms of that that people can see. That

185
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.900
Toerless: is the work focused enough, I think, in the 1st Boff

186
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:19.680
Toerless: it did appear ultimately, because we got into a lot of discussions to be more

187
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.070
Toerless: around the place. So you know,

188
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:36.359
Toerless: how can we create slides that will show focus. And that will show that what's been proposed to be written is going to be, you know.

189
00:31:37.810 --> 00:32:05.059
Toerless: limited enough that it can be achieved in reasonable time and can lead to, you know, implementation. And these implementation can do something useful. So that's, I think, all on the base of it. In the end. It's a sales job, right, and when you're through with all of that, and and that is well done in slides, especially, you know, at the end. Right? So if you go all the way to the end. People need to be refocused again

190
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:13.179
Toerless: on those core core things, right? So broad agreement, you know, by

191
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.069
Toerless: sufficiently many different companies to do the work.

192
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:19.840
Toerless: Work is limited.

193
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:28.609
Toerless: and it can actually result in something that can be implemented. Right? So I think that's what you always have to rethink for yourself.

194
00:32:29.409 --> 00:32:31.119
Toerless: That that's in

195
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:37.110
Toerless: in the final, in the conclusion slides afterwards. Right? So I'm starting from the reverse. Right?

196
00:32:38.650 --> 00:33:03.310
Toerless: And then, of course, the question is, how many you know negative people will there be? Do we know what the biggest concerns were who was expressing the biggest concerns in the 1st buff. Can they be brought over already upfront before the buff starts? Right? So that that people by, you know, feeding them? You know exactly that positive summary information.

197
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.469
Toerless: I don't think we've had a lot of negative pushback. Maybe some people have said.

198
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:23.069
Michael Richardson: You know. Oh, this would be! This is impossible, you know there'd be too slow or something. But I I don't think that was very, even very loud. What did someone else have? Some

199
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.929
Michael Richardson: experience like that, Torrelis? Do you know.

200
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:44.190
Toerless: I don't remember. What I primarily remember was that your slides were a lot of great architecture, exactly all the stuff which, during Anima, you know, Benoit was totally against kind of you don't do any architecture. I just want to do functional stuff that can be implemented.

201
00:33:44.190 --> 00:34:03.200
Toerless: and that may be a little bit outdated. Maybe the Ietf and Isg is more open to architecture, but in the end I think it's it's always good to remember that, you know, showing focus on, you know, here are the drafts that are going to to achieve things that can be implemented. It's still at the core of this stuff.

202
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.150
Toerless: and then you may throw architecture around it.

203
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:11.179
Toerless: But I wouldn't focus on, you know, architecture as as the core deliverable.

204
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:28.179
Luigi Iannone: As far as I remember, during the last the main, let's say the main concerns main point where

205
00:34:28.723 --> 00:34:33.800
Luigi Iannone: routing the the fact that wasn't clear what we do on routing.

206
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.127
Luigi Iannone: and we address this with this part

207
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:45.889
Luigi Iannone: focusing, though, on on forwarding there was the comment on

208
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.369
Luigi Iannone: proof of non transit, which is

209
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:55.919
Luigi Iannone: basically impossible. We have to to state during the buff that this is something that we cannot prove

210
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:59.550
Luigi Iannone: the proof of not transit and

211
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:05.983
Luigi Iannone: in the the 3rd point, the 3rd point was about the the

212
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:11.150
Luigi Iannone: the users of the the tool in order to

213
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:30.667
Luigi Iannone: to say, is it related to the Iab statement. That was also a confusion about the fact that attestation is used to block clients. But it's not our case. So

214
00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.489
Luigi Iannone: I think that there are not.

215
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:41.420
Luigi Iannone: There were no big push back like this is something shouldn't be done right? So those.

216
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:48.350
Toerless: As if they are kind of points to highlight.

217
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:53.225
Toerless: As you know, evolution. Since the 1st buff round to

218
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.299
Toerless: focus and answer the open questions.

219
00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:04.389
Toerless: Right? So so that's kind of good work towards excluding negatives and and open questions.

220
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:17.889
Toerless: I think it doesn't necessarily answer very simple things like, okay, what's you know, for somebody who thinks as an implementer the outcome of this right? So what would be a likely

221
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:26.030
Toerless: Mvp. Right? And an Mvp. That can come out of, you know the 1st charter round.

222
00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.100
Xueyan Song: Can I make a comment?

223
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.040
Luigi Iannone: Sure.

224
00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:42.699
Xueyan Song: Yeah, thank you. It's my 1st time to attend this meeting.

225
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.332
Xueyan Song: is she? And from the key

226
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:57.769
Xueyan Song: about the trouble. I think I agree with that. The problem statement you know, is the 1st priority work.

227
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:06.900
Xueyan Song: So based on the problem analysis we can to do some scope. Narrow

228
00:37:09.459 --> 00:37:14.729
Xueyan Song: for example. You know the use case, the the architecture

229
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:28.704
Xueyan Song: requirements and and accept the scope maybe we can also discuss about the objective of this. Wg,

230
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:41.610
Xueyan Song: and then we can talk about this work. You know the relationship of this work with other wgs, such as rents

231
00:37:42.467 --> 00:37:46.352
Xueyan Song: and may also we can discuss

232
00:37:47.785 --> 00:37:54.440
Xueyan Song: some some work, you know. From other sdos.

233
00:37:54.660 --> 00:38:02.480
Xueyan Song: Oh, so it may be related with other standard organizations.

234
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.090
Xueyan Song: Yeah, it's my comment.

235
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.850
Xueyan Song: Okay, thank you.

236
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:23.500
Luigi Iannone: So you mean we we should also mention other efforts in order standardization bodies.

237
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.160
Luigi Iannone: That's what you said at the end.

238
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:29.980
Xueyan Song: Yeah.

239
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.530
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

240
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.460
Meiling Chen: My. My suggestion is.

241
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:47.501
Meiling Chen: Hey, Malindsay. My suggestion is that we we just focus only on on what we need to do. I mean the charter.

242
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.436
Meiling Chen: but what we have already done. I see the

243
00:38:52.942 --> 00:39:12.039
Meiling Chen: drafts we have already finished. We we can just summarize, what? It! Briefly, but not in too much details. I'm concerned about that. The discussion on the open mic may get into stock in architecture, details.

244
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.379
Luigi Iannone: So not not going in architectural details, right?

245
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.900
Meiling Chen: Yeah, not going too much about architecture.

246
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.959
Toerless: Right. So did you. Did you have an idea about describing an Mvp.

247
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.000
Meiling Chen: No.

248
00:39:56.810 --> 00:40:00.489
Nancy: Torlis, are you asking whether I don't think we need to do that?

249
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.829
Toerless: Well, I it would be I mean.

250
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.539
Meiling Chen: What do you mean for Mvp.

251
00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:15.229
Toerless: Minimum viable product in terms of what? What is the minimum implementation that you know

252
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.909
Toerless: implementers can get out of. You know the working group, and that does something useful.

253
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.809
Nancy: Per user.

254
00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:45.310
Nancy: I mean, we can build something implementable. But will it really address challenges and problems that users are facing.

255
00:40:50.360 --> 00:41:04.060
Chunchi Liu: Well, personally, I think this Mvp. Thing is is good, but it's good to have right. So this is something that we can, you know. Just mention one sentence while we're describing work items like, for example, when we're discussing architectures, we can say

256
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:11.459
Chunchi Liu: we can build open source implementations and demo this in Hackathon, and maybe that's it. And

257
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.279
Chunchi Liu: what do you think.

258
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:36.580
Toerless: Well, so I would say, if we don't have a very clear, here is the one killer. Use case. We're building exactly against that, and that is going to make money. Then I think it might be good to remember how many years lisp meandered in trying to find use cases that were making money right so, and use that as a positive argument

259
00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:51.669
Toerless: that we have a lot of possible scenarios that are listed on the right hand side of the slide of use cases where Nasr is used. But we may not have identified the single, you know.

260
00:41:52.252 --> 00:41:54.510
Toerless: Killer, use case that we're certain about.

261
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:58.350
Nancy: I think that is a very fair point, Torlis.

262
00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:28.380
Toerless: But we you need to know that upfront. Right? So you you should be proactive about that in the same way as yeah. Look how far we've gotten with lisp. And it's still, you know, that's the best technology we have for a lot of different use cases, and that they only evolved over time with the industry, experimenting with them. Right? So so that that you know you're not surprised when people start to ask about you know, how?

263
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:37.699
Toerless: How is this going to be implemented? You know, how is this going to make whoever you know participates in the working group make money? Right? So

264
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:50.590
Toerless: That that proactive stuff, I think that helps to, you know, avoid falling into the trap that people are then saying, Well, you're not ready because you haven't answered that question of of the Mvp.

265
00:42:54.950 --> 00:43:02.779
Nancy: Yeah, I think 2 2 things that you have raised to our list is somewhat concerning. And maybe it's just because we don't have full participation

266
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:13.180
Nancy: is, I don't know how how wide in the number of vendors we have interested in this.

267
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:15.970
Toerless: Well, if the

268
00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:23.059
Toerless: are researchers that are going to build open source references to experiment around with it. That's perfectly fine as well.

269
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.689
Nancy: But I don't see them on the call.

270
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:30.415
Toerless: Yeah, yeah. So, but I think we already knew that anything that

271
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.589
Toerless: can bring 3 time zones together is going to suck.

272
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.220
Nancy: Well, okay, let me another way. In the last boss

273
00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:51.930
Nancy: there were a lot of people that were curious, and they came up to me and asked me a lot of questions, but they had no interest.

274
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:55.339
Nancy: and they didn't see the value proposition

275
00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.260
Nancy: to to your point. Can I make money out of this.

276
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:19.889
Michael Richardson: So. If if you know, even if we get them remote, some of the people that presented that the scion day, and I I don't know if the scion folks will make it there or not. To

277
00:44:21.795 --> 00:44:23.105
Michael Richardson: to Bangkok.

278
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:31.970
Michael Richardson: You know there were some really good use cases there. Where, you know. Yeah, things.

279
00:44:33.870 --> 00:45:00.050
Michael Richardson: were either. The case of of network users who didn't want to do didn't want to pay for lease lines anymore, and wanted more flexibility and more resilience by essentially throwing their hat in with everyone else. So they are looking at saving money. Okay? And then we had the operators who were responding to that, who were like, Oh, okay, I'm going to sell, not just a

280
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:04.630
Michael Richardson: a dark fiber from point A to Point B, but a managed service.

281
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:09.330
Michael Richardson: and then we had the question of the vendors who were going to supply them equipment right?

282
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.539
Michael Richardson: And so I think the latter one is well represented that the itf

283
00:45:15.021 --> 00:45:19.240
Michael Richardson: but the previous 2, you know, that would be great to have

284
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:25.709
Michael Richardson: something there. But I think we're kind of. We're a little bit past that point, but

285
00:45:26.433 --> 00:45:31.999
Michael Richardson: and I don't know that we have time to do it, but maybe we should have us have some connection there to

286
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:35.749
Michael Richardson: to what's what's happened at the Scion day, and things like that.

287
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.010
Nancy: So someone who's not in this. What scion day.

288
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:51.729
Michael Richardson: Scion Day was a 1 day event back in October that they've been doing yearly for 2 or 3 years, which is the scion SCIO, n, which is this

289
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:58.430
Michael Richardson: Swiss consortium that has built an overlay network that does something like what we're nasser does.

290
00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.590
Nancy: Oh, okay.

291
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:22.260
Michael Richardson: Okay? And there, there are some Internet drafts. And they may be good folk. Good, good rep. They should be on that draft document that draft page there, 3 lines down and whether or not they're the right way to go. I don't know, because there's technical details that I don't understand yet. But

292
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:38.309
Michael Richardson: They've at least done this in in, you know, white box implemented overlay networks and seem to be reasonably successful at doing the things that I just said like, so so

293
00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:40.690
Michael Richardson: I.

294
00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:45.660
Luigi Iannone: Think there are a couple of needs on the science side compared to NASA, because

295
00:46:46.291 --> 00:47:09.339
Luigi Iannone: this is an overlay. The main use case is banking. Apparently Swiss banking system is using it. There is a a lot of routing there, a lot of routing and certification on the routing side. They don't have. Really. An explicit proof of transit, because once you you

296
00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:19.069
Luigi Iannone: secure, let's say the routing, and you trust everything that is there, then you don't need the proof of concept, because, anyway, you are in a trusted environment.

297
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:20.030
Luigi Iannone: So.

298
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:26.860
Michael Richardson: Well, I would put it differently. I would say that the proof of transit was probably too expensive

299
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.360
Michael Richardson: to be

300
00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:41.260
Michael Richardson: okay. And and so I think it's a place where that's where the push is like. Well, no, we want to put this. Put this down in the forwarding layer, but to do that requires a larger investment.

301
00:47:41.785 --> 00:47:59.669
Michael Richardson: And therefore a a a bigger market. But there was a was a presentation about well, there were 2 presentations. What that I was saying. One of them was about an entity. That was, I think, that was the Swiss Settlement Bank

302
00:48:00.327 --> 00:48:07.200
Michael Richardson: in the middle of the pandemic, the beginning of the pandemic. They had a 0 day exploit on their VPN. Server.

303
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.830
Michael Richardson: and

304
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:22.740
Michael Richardson: so they were in a situation of We can't go to the office and fix it because we're not allowed to. And we're not sure if we should use the VPN. Server because to fix the VPN. Server, because it's

305
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:38.650
Michael Richardson: whatever. And then they realized, oh, but we but the VPN. Server also knows whether or not the traffic is coming through the overlay scion network. And so they could say, we can turn off connectivity from outside Switzerland.

306
00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:59.999
Michael Richardson: because that so that that completely limits our our exposure. And then they're like, oh, okay. So now we can, we can fix the we can do the upgrade we wanted to do, etc, and that that seemed to be a real, a real thing, and they might, you know, later on, have re-enabled it because people need to remote work from you know

307
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:04.404
Michael Richardson: that part of France that's on the other side of la me

308
00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:21.560
Michael Richardson: and you know whatever, but that they could actually be more skeptical about those those addresses because they're less there and then. The other example that was given was actually, I think it was actually a

309
00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.610
Michael Richardson: a city traffic control

310
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:39.740
Michael Richardson: kind of network, right? I mean, like physical cars and trucks and stuff network. And they just were tired of running their own lease lines. So they wanted to have a system that was had a higher assurance level.

311
00:49:40.155 --> 00:50:02.299
Michael Richardson: Then the open Internet. But, on the other hand, they just wanted to be able to buy commodity Internet connections, from whatever you know, from a variety of suppliers. So they weren't actually, ever, you know, beholden to one supplier. And that, they wouldn't have their whole network go down at the same time.

312
00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:03.960
Toerless: But so

313
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:20.500
Toerless: what? What is the likely? You know? Easiest explanation of the positioning of NASA versus scion right is, is, can we position? NASA, is something that a scion solution could add on to get more security.

314
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:21.360
Michael Richardson: Yes.

315
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.690
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

316
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:24.059
Michael Richardson: Yes, I would call it.

317
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.029
Toerless: Can we can we call.

318
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.400
Michael Richardson: File.

319
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.050
Toerless: Can we get hire people to support that statement?

320
00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.379
Michael Richardson: Nasr version 0 point 8.

321
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:37.340
Toerless: No, no, wait a second. Can we get scion people to support that statement?

322
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:37.750
Nancy: Right.

323
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:38.730
Michael Richardson: I think so.

324
00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.950
Michael Richardson: Okay, I think that.

325
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:44.810
Nancy: I have people participating in this.

326
00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:53.179
Nancy: I mean, when Torres is asking, can they? You know they actually be need need to be in the room.

327
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:58.880
Toerless: Well, not necessarily, you know. I think if if you do, the

328
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:27.280
Toerless: I don't want to put a name to it, although most people would know who I'm thinking of. But if you basically think of the one document where you write stuff that you can have everybody contributing to the effort, sign off on and put them on as co-authors on. Then, you know, that can be used as a reference for people not in the room, especially in Bangkok, when that may be a limited thing, but you can point to it

329
00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:28.320
Toerless: right

330
00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:46.640
Toerless: if you, if if we do, have, you know, 10 or 12 people that are all interested in different aspects of these of of NASA. Right then figure out what is the document? You can write that where you can put all of these people on a list of authors. That document doesn't have to survive

331
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:53.499
Toerless: right? But it's a statement of support. It's a statement of engagement and specific interests in in NASA,

332
00:51:54.010 --> 00:52:01.719
Toerless: right that that can chime in. For you know, people not being in the room. Of course, you know, it would be nicer to have people in the room

333
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:08.229
Toerless: or remotely attending. But you know, especially if you want to target Bangkok, I wouldn't want to count on that.

334
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:17.498
Nancy: Yeah, and you corrected me. Well, cause when I said in the room, I didn't mean physically in the room.

335
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:34.719
Toerless: But I mean, even even if if all these people are in the room, a lot of people are looking through the documents and making decisions, especially from Isg or so right there. They're not going to be all in the room. They're looking at the documents, and you know they're they're looking at the list of authors right.

336
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:36.200
Nancy: Correct.

337
00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:53.889
Toerless: So that's never a bad thing. Of course you'll never get a document through with all these names, but if if you can look at the list of names and try, then easily figure out, what are they going to contribute? What are they going to support of the technology? Then that's a lot of help for decision makers in the Itf.

338
00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:59.280
Nancy: So it's a question of can we get such a letter with

339
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.449
Nancy: people that are willing to, you know.

340
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:13.129
Nancy: Usually, when I do an adoption. Call on a draft. I I try and probe. You know, people who would review the draft people who would implement the draft.

341
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.800
Nancy: I forget the 3rd question. But so I think you're.

342
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:45.609
Toerless: It's kind of if you have something like, you know the NASA problem statement. And you know directions. For you know, experimentation, right? So kind of you know this, this, these are the problems we want to get solved here, the experiments we would like NASA as a working group to do. And then you put all the you know people who are, you know, saying yes, they're interested. They're supporting the effort and or even they're contributing to it. You put that as names on.

343
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:51.670
Toerless: So that's kind of some written evidence, for you know, sufficient, you know, participation in Nasr.

344
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:52.340
Nancy: Hmm.

345
00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.730
Chunchi Liu: In a problem statement, draft.

346
00:53:56.390 --> 00:54:04.259
Toerless: For example, right something around that right, something which is intangible enough that all the people will be happy to have their name mentioned in there.

347
00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.570
Chunchi Liu: Yeah, that'll be a great idea.

348
00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:19.840
Toerless: And that doesn't have to be a document that ultimately gets out of NASA. Right? So that doesn't have to become a deliverable.

349
00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:21.430
Nancy: Oh, it's.

350
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:22.620
Toerless: Postage, document.

351
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:24.540
Nancy: Right.

352
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:39.609
Luigi Iannone: Wouldn't be the A use case document, a possibility where people say this is the use case that I'm interested in, and I think that NASA can solve it.

353
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:51.280
Toerless: It could be, it could be right. So. But that's really, you know, you need to sit down, create the list of names and try to figure out what what is the best document that that they'll all sign off on.

354
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:59.779
Luigi Iannone: We have the list of use cases of the previous side of the slide. Those can be.

355
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:02.659
Nancy: So it's the question of.

356
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.809
Toerless: When somebody presents the use cases.

357
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.010
Nancy: As part of the problem statement that

358
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:13.940
Nancy: that set of slides could have

359
00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:27.070
Nancy: the list of names and contacts of the vendors, proponents that are effectively validating.

360
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.880
Nancy: The use cases.

361
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.670
Nancy: And by way, it's showing support.

362
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:47.200
Chunchi Liu: Yes, there should be a 1 pager slide. And also

363
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:58.670
Chunchi Liu: let's just decide like, where where should we put this written evidence? In which document. Maybe just in the requirement and problem statement document, we can just have another section.

364
00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:03.349
Nancy: Guys, it doesn't have to be cast in stone

365
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:07.940
Nancy: in the charter or the document I'm saying

366
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:14.969
Nancy: for this, Boff, we want to demonstrate that there is a wider community.

367
00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:21.089
Nancy: and so putting in in the presentation should be sufficient.

368
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:37.960
Toerless: And problem statement can be broader than full use cases. For example, you can have a researcher that loves to do. Oh, I don't know, p. 4. Forwarding code and doesn't really have an idea about the overall use case stuff, but would be saying, Hey, we can validate. We.

369
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:51.959
Toerless: you know, are interested to implement that proof of concept in p. 4, code or so. Right? So that's something in the problem statement where you know validation of the feasibility of, you know that proof of transit and high speed forwarding stuff, just as an example.

370
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.270
Toerless: right.

371
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.549
Nancy: Michael, you posted Nicholas name on the chat.

372
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.679
Nancy: is he someone that's been active.

373
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:20.357
Michael Richardson: Yeah, I would say so. I don't know that he's he certainly was at the last.

374
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:21.255
Nancy: Off.

375
00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:23.330
Michael Richardson: He was at the.

376
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:24.590
Nancy: Alright, so.

377
00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:25.610
Luigi Iannone: In Dublin.

378
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.480
Michael Richardson: Yeah. He was at.

379
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:26.980
Luigi Iannone: It wasn't.

380
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:35.280
Michael Richardson: Dublin. He was in Dublin, and he's he spoke. He actually spoke at previous ripe about scion

381
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:43.070
Michael Richardson: not this past one, but the one before, and I believe he was at our side meeting in

382
00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.289
Michael Richardson: Where were we in the summer?

383
00:57:50.252 --> 00:57:52.420
Luigi Iannone: No, that's good, but it's.

384
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.710
Toerless: Was Vancouver.

385
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.190
Michael Richardson: Vancouver. I think he was in Vancouver. I think he was in Vancouver.

386
00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:03.149
Michael Richardson: anyway, I also posted a link to the diagram I just did about Lac Lemay. There you go.

387
00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:15.139
Toerless: Well, scion is certainly interesting. I'm not sure what what amount of reciprocity they would like to see for scion itself as a solution to somehow get through.

388
00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:25.140
Michael Richardson: So. So one of the comments, one of the limitations for Scion's ability to grow is that there is only one source of of it

389
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:33.983
Michael Richardson: right? There's an open source project, but it's not. It's not feature. It's not feature competitive with the other

390
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:41.369
Michael Richardson: entity. And the clients who want to use this are like, well, this is wonderful, but I can't have a single source.

391
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:48.670
Toerless: Yeah, but I understood. But how are they going to solve that? I mean, do you think that

392
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:54.199
Toerless: whole of scion itself could or should be specified with a Nasr.

393
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:59.899
Michael Richardson: I think that's the only way of them actually growing beyond that and getting, you know.

394
00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:15.159
Michael Richardson: commodity, silicon, that that can do proof of transit. For instance, I don't think there's a lot of remote attestation involved today in scion, but I think it's these are all things like, you know, if we had more money and

395
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:28.080
Michael Richardson: mind share, and whatever that they would go that way. So I would say, think of them as a interested in original, you know, promoter or implementer.

396
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.029
Michael Richardson: Well, that's my guess.

397
00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:34.850
Toerless: I think the problem with scion in that extent is that

398
00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:45.269
Toerless: they they have a complete solution with, you know, as people said, a lot of routing and other aspects in there which you know people in the Itf might feel to be.

399
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:48.560
Michael Richardson: I would say they have a minimum viable product.

400
00:59:49.220 --> 01:00:00.040
Michael Richardson: Okay, that satisfies 70% of the needs of their current users. They have a bunch for whom that is not enough.

401
01:00:01.013 --> 01:00:07.690
Michael Richardson: And and then they have a a multiple source problem.

402
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:19.150
Michael Richardson: So I don't think they can. I don't think, given the size of their current market, as it were, there is, which is limited by the what their solution can do.

403
01:00:19.743 --> 01:00:24.549
Michael Richardson: I don't think that, and there will be another entrance entrant into that market.

404
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:30.029
Michael Richardson: As it is so, I think that they need to grow a little bit.

405
01:00:30.537 --> 01:00:50.109
Michael Richardson: And I think that this is the right way, and I'm not going to speak for Nicola, but my impression is from you know, the interactions I've had with him is that he is very enthusiastic about this, and that any pieces of scion that we need to use, or cannibalize, or or whatever they are, they are

406
01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:52.950
Michael Richardson: massively happy with that right.

407
01:00:52.950 --> 01:01:01.810
Toerless: Okay. But so so let's my point was, we are not targeting to get all of scion standardized in NASA.

408
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:03.150
Nancy: No.

409
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:08.239
Michael Richardson: No, there could be some things that we don't like or don't need, or we do differently.

410
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:15.939
Michael Richardson: Okay. But I would say, that's a discussion. A wonderful problem discussion to have once the group is chartered.

411
01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:20.179
Michael Richardson: I don't think we put any words that say we are in a base on scion, so I don't think.

412
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:34.520
Toerless: No, no, understood. I'm just. I'm just saying I was just wondering about the reciprocity that they might be expecting in terms of you know any help to to get all of scion somehow through the Ietf. But that certainly is a broader problem.

413
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:44.649
Luigi Iannone: They are trying to to push science through the art here, so far as far as I know, because they have a set of documents that they regularly

414
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:49.540
Luigi Iannone: updating panarchy. Alpha, aware networking research group.

415
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.230
Toerless: Okay.

416
01:01:52.340 --> 01:02:03.549
Toerless: well, so what would be good to understand that they're happy, you know, to support us, even though we from Nasser cannot give a lot of reciprocity instead beyond.

417
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:11.199
Luigi Iannone: So, as Michael said, Nicola was participating in the side meetings at the very beginning. I I think that that

418
01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:14.759
Luigi Iannone: his issue is. He doesn't see

419
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:25.780
Luigi Iannone: how much science fits or doesn't fit in in the NASA scope. So that's why he's like, let's say.

420
01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:35.090
Luigi Iannone: not the main guy pushing for Nasser is looking is nasser, useful or not for science. That's my impression.

421
01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.940
Toerless: No, but I think I think maybe we can even generalize this this type of use case right? That there may be, you know, secure

422
01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.359
Toerless: virtual overlay networks.

423
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:55.039
Toerless: Whom are, you know, at least in part, using proprietary architectures?

424
01:02:55.511 --> 01:03:01.840
Toerless: You know, which I think is true for most of the Sdn. And maybe one big group of

425
01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:23.749
Toerless: you know, use cases, for Nasr is to be, you know, an underlying forwarding component to help those networks, even though the whole architecture may not be itf standardized, and scion may be an example which, for example, might get, you know, documented through Irtf or other tracks in the itf. And

426
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:29.529
Toerless: but it may be just one of those type of solutions that could use. NASA

427
01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:35.149
Toerless: might be good good sales story.

428
01:03:37.750 --> 01:04:06.849
Meiling Chen: Or or we can can from another side from the operators site is assigning on the Swisscom network. Maybe Swisscom can provide some experience, so can we find someone from Swisscom who are interested about such as what a CIO and card they cannot do, but can do.

429
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.580
Toerless: Yeah, I think that that I think this this this point. What

430
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:27.729
Toerless: NASA could help Scion to do better. I think Michael or others from the team could write it up, and then we can exactly find the the people's name from

431
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.700
Toerless: either scion and or operators that are putting it in that would support that notion.

432
01:04:52.640 --> 01:05:02.050
Chunchi Liu: Well from my previous experiences with sign people I have reached out to them several times. They

433
01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:27.650
Chunchi Liu: have. They appear to be, you know, kind of want to synchronize their protocols very independently. Like based on their based on on their own implementation. So my suggestion is that because now they already, you know, working the irtf and they might have some progress. Their incentive to work with us might be

434
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:42.520
Chunchi Liu: week. So my my suggestion is that maybe we should. We should have like a self-contained story, and not to have many dependent on sign as a as a blocker or dependent.

435
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:52.619
Toerless: No, no, agreed. Which is why I was also suggesting to do the work writing down text that relates to scion ourself

436
01:05:52.930 --> 01:06:00.570
Toerless: and then get. You know, the name of people from scion or operators using scion to sign off on that

437
01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:06.210
Toerless: right something that makes it easy for them to support it without having to invest work.

438
01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:19.230
Luigi Iannone: I think we speak more about the the science use case rather than the science solution itself. Right?

439
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.409
Michael Richardson: Yeah, that's what I would say.

440
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:22.060
Nancy: Yep.

441
01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.769
Toerless: So the scion type use case.

442
01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.889
Toerless: or specifically the sign use case.

443
01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:41.860
Luigi Iannone: So say on the end is is banking. That's the main use case right.

444
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:44.979
Toerless: Well, that that's what makes the money. Yes.

445
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:46.570
Chunchi Liu: Yes.

446
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:50.359
Toerless: There is no reason why it should be limited to that.

447
01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:59.279
Toerless: No, but that's basically how they make their money, and they're happy with it, and they don't need more to keep themselves afloat.

448
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:11.309
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, actually, they want more, because some of the people require interoperability with different implementation. That is why they at the end they reached out to.

449
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:16.770
Luigi Iannone: So they they are greedy as well, just joking, just joking.

450
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:18.210
Toerless: I don't know if it's.

451
01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.070
Luigi Iannone: No, no makes sense. I mean what they do absolutely just joking.

452
01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:44.460
Toerless: Do we have other adjacencies? Have has anyone talked with the lisp folks which by themselves don't really have any serious security layer, but but always trying to combine with security methods.

453
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:49.099
Toerless: is there, you know, an adjacency that could be defined through use cases.

454
01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.760
Michael Richardson: Sounds reasonable.

455
01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:53.040
Michael Richardson: I haven't talked to them, but.

456
01:07:54.688 --> 01:08:01.139
Luigi Iannone: I sent several emails on the mailing list since I'm chairing that working group. But nobody came back

457
01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.779
Luigi Iannone: officially, you know. Let's say to.

458
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:09.370
Luigi Iannone: I think there were folks in the boss that participate. But today.

459
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.480
Luigi Iannone: just as subservice, let's say not

460
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:14.800
Luigi Iannone: but what kind of of of

461
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:27.100
Luigi Iannone: do you mean using lisp as a NASA solution or part of it of the what do you mean? Exactly. Totals.

462
01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.080
Toerless: Yeah, I I mean.

463
01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:39.949
Toerless: lisp is used for for overlay Vpns, right? So. And and lisp by itself doesn't have security right? So you combine it with some form of security.

464
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:51.070
Luigi Iannone: Security is broad. What do you have is that you can have a encrypted tunnels. Okay?

465
01:08:51.618 --> 01:09:00.859
Luigi Iannone: And and yeah, and you have a mean to secure the mapping system because you have to do a look up for the mapping, and that's it. But it's not

466
01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:09.029
Luigi Iannone: specifically designed for secure or trusted environments, like something NASA will.

467
01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:11.940
Luigi Iannone: Oh, wants to do.

468
01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:22.760
Toerless: No, no, I was just throwing this in as kind of the closest thing to, you. Know something in the itf that does overlay networking.

469
01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:24.500
Luigi Iannone: Oh, yeah.

470
01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:30.749
Toerless: Right, and doesn't have a fixed and done security architecture.

471
01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:34.680
Luigi Iannone: True correct.

472
01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:43.949
Toerless: I'm not saying I have a solution. I'd rather like the possible opportunity to define an adjacency in the iitf.

473
01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:50.359
Toerless: which you know scion itself is not right because it's not in the itf, otherwise.

474
01:09:51.460 --> 01:10:01.760
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, and just trying to to better understand. What do you mean by adjacency? You mean that NASA could be the the security architecture of lisp. Something like that. You mean.

475
01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.940
Toerless: One option, of course. Right? I mean, let's test

476
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:15.049
Toerless: so so many things. Right? So like, here is how Nasr could make certain type of lisp use cases better. And you have some lisp people that say, yeah, sounds like a good idea.

477
01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.580
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

478
01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.920
Toerless: And I totally don't know what that exactly would be.

479
01:10:24.826 --> 01:10:27.460
Luigi Iannone: I can think about it.

480
01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:32.900
Toerless: But again, don't don't think about you know these these type of you know

481
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:47.660
Toerless: open questions. If you think you already have sufficiently many names of people with use cases whose name you can put up on the slide on the problem statement. Right? So start with, you know what you think you have solid

482
01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:51.420
Toerless: in terms of evidence of support and

483
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:54.440
Toerless: work that people are going to do.

484
01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:59.359
Toerless: And only if you know you think that list is insufficient, go further.

485
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:07.749
Toerless: Because I haven't seen that list. Right? So that's

486
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:32.090
Toerless: I mean, I'm just trying to explain this process of kind of starting from the end right so, and going back

487
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:41.059
Toerless: through the charter right? So this bottom up right? So you you're top down, starting from the chart and everything. And I'm

488
01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:54.539
Toerless: bottom up in terms of okay, what's the list of people we can work with? What can we get from them? How do we, you know, put this together on slide or in a problem statement with the names, reach out to them individually.

489
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.359
Toerless: See that they agree on. You know what we would like

490
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:03.969
Toerless: to say they're supporting a NASA, right? So that type of.

491
01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:13.059
Luigi Iannone: Yes, and this should be be before actually discussing the chapter. I mean agenda. Wise, right?

492
01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:22.600
Toerless: Well, no, I mean in the end, this is, this is kind of here's the support we have. Here's kind of that is something that ultimately the most important part is at the end.

493
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:26.049
Toerless: When you summarize, when you restate right, that.

494
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:28.949
Toerless: When you want to show the support. The people

495
01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:35.209
Toerless: the names. That stuff right? However, what whatever doing in the beginning?

496
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:45.350
Toerless: That's that's all. Just entertainment. The the important stuff is when people want to start open. Mic, what what are you going to say in the last 5 min before the open mic.

497
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:48.810
Toerless: That's basically your restatement and summary.

498
01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:50.939
Toerless: That's when you need to. Kind of.

499
01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.259
Toerless: That's that's the most important stuff to have worked out.

500
01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.620
Luigi Iannone: Let's see.

501
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.409
Chunchi Liu: I think the time is running out a little bit.

502
01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.689
Michael Richardson: Oh, yes, actually.

503
01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:15.589
Chunchi Liu: But we have the important points, I think.

504
01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.010
Luigi Iannone: Yes,

505
01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:35.883
Luigi Iannone: we just need to to to start to to structure the slide slides so that we we have something to discuss in the next meeting, which is

506
01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.679
Luigi Iannone: on February 12.th

507
01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.410
Luigi Iannone: Different time, as usual.

508
01:13:42.912 --> 01:13:44.870
Luigi Iannone: We're trying to.

509
01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:48.679
Nancy: My early time, Luigi, for the next one. Right sorry.

510
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:53.880
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, so oh, that's fine.

511
01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:54.960
Toerless: Good time.

512
01:13:56.798 --> 01:14:00.211
Luigi Iannone: In Europe. It's pretty comfortable.

513
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.719
Toerless: Oh, this this is! This is even California friendly.

514
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:04.780
Nancy: Yeah.

515
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.217
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, it's a little bit tougher in Asia.

516
01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:17.912
Toerless: My my next interim has to be 4 Am. For me, so it's or 5 am. So it's.

517
01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.010
Nancy: Harry.

518
01:14:20.407 --> 01:14:21.419
Toerless: Things you do.

519
01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:46.560
Chunchi Liu: So, so I think the time is okay. And I suggest, maybe this time we should have it like online Google slide or something that we all iterate and work on instead of you know, people proposing, you know, slides. Should we? Should, we, you know, create a online slide folder and that that kind of thing, and send to the list.

520
01:14:47.665 --> 01:14:50.770
Luigi Iannone: That's not a bad idea. I can do that.

521
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:54.380
Chunchi Liu: Yep.

522
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:59.689
Luigi Iannone: Google, if Google Docs works for everybody we can, we can use that tool.

523
01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:05.522
Chunchi Liu: Yeah. And then we can write whatever you know.

524
01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:07.900
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

525
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:08.459
Luigi Iannone: All the people.

526
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:25.259
Toerless: That you think of really reach out individually to them and ask them if they're going to be in Bangkok, or if if they're planning to remotely attend as the 1st step, and you know, once you even get responses from them, then the next step is to see if you know

527
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:27.910
Toerless: you know what, what.

528
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:35.269
Toerless: what could be written into an appropriate document to be able to have their name supportive on

529
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:40.140
Toerless: a slide about it, or even the problem, statement, use case, kind of document.

530
01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:49.430
