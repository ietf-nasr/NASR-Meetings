00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.120
Luigi Iannone: Test

2
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.750
Luigi Iannone: Ashby

3
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.280
Luigi Iannone: given.

4
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.679
Nancy: Hey! Luigi.

5
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.170
Luigi Iannone: Hi, Nancy! Can you hear me?

6
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.279
Nancy: I can't for some reason on my phone.

7
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.260
Luigi Iannone: Huge echo, Wow!

8
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.219
Nancy: Okay, Luigi. Can you hear me better now?

9
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.330
Luigi Iannone: Yes, I do. I hear you.

10
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.360
Luigi Iannone: So you are able to unmute.

11
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.230
Nancy: Yes.

12
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.670
Luigi Iannone: Good, good.

13
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.420
Nancy: But I can either look at the screen or mute and unmute on my phone.

14
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.130
Nancy: Interesting, the phone app has a very different interface.

15
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.239
Luigi Iannone: Actually, I did never use the the

16
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.505
Luigi Iannone: the app on the phone, so I don't know.

17
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.599
Nancy: Yeah, it's my 1st time. That's why I was like, Oh, I should join a couple of minutes before.

18
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:41.429
Nancy: So I apologize. I'm gonna have to let you run the meeting, because, like I said, it's gonna take me 25 min to drive.

19
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.069
Nancy: and then I'll park, and then I'm gonna have to leave 5 min before the top of the hour

20
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.440
Nancy: to get to my doctor's appointment.

21
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.709
Luigi Iannone: We don't necessarily need to to

22
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.760
Luigi Iannone: consume the whole hour. I mean, it depends how the discussion goes on.

23
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.090
Luigi Iannone: That's true.

24
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.790
Luigi Iannone: Let's see.

25
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.429
Luigi Iannone: You'll see.

26
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.432
Nancy: Okay, I'll try and put more effort because

27
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:14.920
Nancy: Today, I'm presuming today will be a light work day, because tomorrow is a Us. Holiday.

28
00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:24.890
Nancy: So I've got to read the architecture. The draft that Michael put together in the proposed architecture, as well as the charter.

29
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:32.460
Nancy: Because the thing you know, as we noted, we need to focus on on tightening up the charter.

30
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.710
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, the charter. We need to do quite some

31
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.849
Luigi Iannone: changes. Actually, I put it on the github so that everyone could and contribute it.

32
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.390
Nancy: See? You.

33
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.180
Nancy: Okay.

34
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.179
Luigi Iannone: Here it is, here it is! I will! There! There is the link in the slide. I will.

35
00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:59.232
Luigi Iannone: Put it on the mailing list. This is just a a a copy of what was previously on the private

36
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.950
Luigi Iannone: on the account of Peter Lee Chunky from.

37
00:08:05.342 --> 00:08:06.519
Nancy: Got it. Okay.

38
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:06.960
Luigi Iannone: No.

39
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.239
Luigi Iannone: But now, now and now there is.

40
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:17.720
Luigi Iannone: So basically, there is a I created an organization quite few months ago. Ikf nasser, okay.

41
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.040
Nancy: Oh, yes, good!

42
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.998
Luigi Iannone: And and then we have

43
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:34.159
Luigi Iannone: few repositories. Now, the Dot Github is just technical for the organization. For the readmi there is all the material of the site meeting, small site meeting in the last Itf

44
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.950
Luigi Iannone: and the the charter, the National Charter.

45
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:45.390
Luigi Iannone: So we'll and then if we click here we go to the real, chopped it.

46
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.269
Nancy: Sounds like a plan.

47
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:58.420
Luigi Iannone: Yeah. So yes, we need to to change it a little bit. As a consequence of the of the feedback, we received

48
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:04.560
Luigi Iannone: the latest discussion, etc, etc. But but it's a good start already, is a good start.

49
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.339
Nancy: Okay, I will put myself on mute again.

50
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.649
Nancy: In case there's too much noise in the car.

51
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:24.049
Luigi Iannone: Okay, we will wait on 2 more minutes. Then maybe we we can start

52
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.620
Luigi Iannone: and I put back the slides.

53
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.700
Luigi Iannone: Okay, maybe we can start. Okay.

54
00:11:31.875 --> 00:11:38.860
Luigi Iannone: so welcome, everybody. This is the first, st let's say, interim meeting. Of the NASA

55
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:48.200
Luigi Iannone: both. This is the status that we have so far to date

56
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:56.057
Luigi Iannone: today. Agenda is pretty simple, as I shared it on the mailing list. So we just start. Then there is Peter that

57
00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:02.060
Luigi Iannone: proposed to have a presentation on a upstack. Proof of transit mechanism.

58
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:19.019
Luigi Iannone: Okay, I prepared a few points as a answer to the one of the comments that we had about the Ieb statement. And then maybe we go over the documents that we have and the charter that we have. Okay.

59
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:28.919
Luigi Iannone: And just for the records, let me repeat that this session is recorded 1st of all, and secondly,

60
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:54.020
Luigi Iannone: As I said in in A, in the email, the the Isg make made us aware to the fact that usually above has only 2 meetings. Okay, now, interim meetings kind of a gray zone. But still interim meeting, somebody can complain and say, Oh, but you you are having more than above meeting official buff.

61
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.770
Luigi Iannone: So we did. We decided

62
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:19.749
Luigi Iannone: to to switch to, let's say side meetings. Let's call it this way. So we use zoom, we don't use the ietf resources, but still the work will go on, and we will prepare minutes we share the material, etc. Etc. The only difference will be that is on Github.

63
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:27.399
Luigi Iannone: Okay? And just actually, as I was showing to Nancy, I will come back to this later. But

64
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.320
Luigi Iannone: I I created

65
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:42.680
Luigi Iannone: an Itf NASA organization. Okay, so that we can collect here all all the material. So far, there are 3 repositories.

66
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:58.789
Luigi Iannone: The dot github is something related to to the fact that we have an organization, and there is a readme on the 1st page there is the a repository for all the material and minutes of the site meeting that we had in Dublin.

67
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:09.990
Luigi Iannone: Did import from Peter's repository the the charter, as was drafted a few months ago.

68
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.569
Luigi Iannone: and the idea is to put everything in this

69
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:22.690
Luigi Iannone: organization in several repositories, so that is available for us, but also for the Isg. At some point when they have to

70
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:28.129
Luigi Iannone: made a decision, make a decision about whether or not form a working group.

71
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.199
Luigi Iannone: or obviously we will try to work to. Yes, we will have a working group.

72
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.979
Luigi Iannone: And Yutaka, you. I see you raised your hand. You want to say something.

73
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.080
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah. Hi.

74
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.240
Luigi Iannone: It's on. Sorry.

75
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.690
Yutaka OIWA: Yes, yeah. So I have a roughly. So

76
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:56.300
Yutaka OIWA: this account for the book meeting is, is it

77
00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:06.449
Yutaka OIWA: more clearly? We have 2 meetings for both double z, forming and non double z, forming both.

78
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.070
Yutaka OIWA: So we. So we did already, once for the

79
00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:22.260
Yutaka OIWA: non, forming both. So we we have another only one slot for the the forming above, where we have 2 more slots.

80
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.309
Luigi Iannone: No one more slot.

81
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.690
Yutaka OIWA: That's my.

82
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.480
Luigi Iannone: I understand? Yeah. So.

83
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.849
Yutaka OIWA: Oh, that's that's really critical. I see.

84
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:46.169
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, but that that is one of the reason why we didn't officially meet in in Dublin in order to better prepare for the next meeting in Bangkok, so to to have the to work for the working group for me, both.

85
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.249
Yutaka OIWA: I see. Yeah, thank you. That's that's clear for me. Thank you.

86
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:53.840
Luigi Iannone: Michael.

87
00:15:56.341 --> 00:16:03.959
Michael Richardson: I'm very surprised and shocked that the Isg is pushed back on us, actually organizing things to be successful.

88
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:15.369
Michael Richardson: I would like to know who really, I mean, it's up to the Isg to decide whether we've had too much resources or whatever

89
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.660
Michael Richardson: so.

90
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.439
Nancy: Michael, I see I think it's more of the formality.

91
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.130
Luigi Iannone: Yeah.

92
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:29.840
Nancy: Right, and so there might have been a confusion when there was the request and the request.

93
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:38.619
Nancy: Anyway, we can't do a formal interim meeting, because then that does call the the notion of

94
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.829
Nancy: you know this gets into the issue of is it a side meeting, or is the interim?

95
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.270
Nancy: The interim is viewed more as an official.

96
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:54.249
Michael Richardson: So that's that's all. That's all within the Isg to decide. That's that's all within their their their mandate.

97
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:59.469
Michael Richardson: To to to do something or not. So

98
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:07.929
Michael Richardson: all they're really doing is making us use an inferior technology that we don't control for no benefit to anybody

99
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.089
Michael Richardson: like. So you say it's formality. But anyway, I I just I'd like to know

100
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:21.289
Michael Richardson: who said this and why, and I'll ask that offline. And I I think it's a stupidity. Like.

101
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.990
Luigi Iannone: But from my understanding there is no

102
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:31.590
Luigi Iannone: a formal push back. Oh, you don't have to do it, but may someone I don't honestly.

103
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:38.710
Michael Richardson: Yeah, well, that's just it. Some somebody who doesn't want to identify themselves as making, you know illusions.

104
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.499
Luigi Iannone: Let's say that the right.

105
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:39.819
Michael Richardson: You know.

106
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:47.439
Luigi Iannone: Question whether or not has an it is announced on the announced mailing list is nasser

107
00:17:47.981 --> 00:18:03.208
Luigi Iannone: both interim. So is above meeting or not so in in in the gray Zone, rightfully, Deb suggested to to use a different tool, and then then and cancel the official. But

108
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.590
Michael Richardson: Okay.

109
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.490
Luigi Iannone: It was. It was Deb. All right. That's fine site.

110
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:13.409
Michael Richardson: The Isg can also let us have 4 Boffs if we want to, right if they want to. Rather, if they think that

111
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.760
Michael Richardson: that's a huge thing. They, this is advice, right? It's not. It's not a okay. So

112
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.879
Michael Richardson: anyway, I'm not continue. But I'm gonna complain. That's all.

113
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:28.269
Nancy: Yeah, I was, gonna say, Michael, we should focus more towards you know the work that we need to get done as opposed to.

114
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:46.544
Michael Richardson: And so my other. My other comment was, that if you followed the Github thing, then you wind up, you would have called it itf working group, Nasr, but you can fix that later. And also there's some stuff the Secretariat does to back us up. But of course they won't do that till we're actually working group. So but anyway,

115
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.750
Luigi Iannone: I mean a lot. This can be easily fixed in the future.

116
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:56.229
Michael Richardson: It can be fixed. Yeah, yeah. So that's great. Thank you for creating that group. I'm I makes it much easier to find things.

117
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:05.709
Luigi Iannone: Good good. I will try to to keep it up to date and centralize everything there, so that that we have easy access. Okay.

118
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:19.030
Luigi Iannone: okay. If there are no more raised hands or questions, I would say that Peter can take the floor and share the slides.

119
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.729
Luigi Iannone: And is that fine, Peter.

120
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:30.059
Peter Liu: Yes, I have a question about the charter, but can I save for for later, for the the item.

121
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.930
Luigi Iannone: At the end. Yeah, okay, okay.

122
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.670
Peter Liu: Right.

123
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:42.640
Peter Liu: It says. Disabled share. The host disabled permission. Thing.

124
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.219
Luigi Iannone: Let me check.

125
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.220
Peter Liu: Said these.

126
00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.730
Luigi Iannone: One second who can share all participants

127
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.609
Luigi Iannone: who can start sharing all participants.

128
00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.130
Peter Liu: Oh!

129
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.360
Luigi Iannone: Can you try again.

130
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.150
Peter Liu: Yes, I think now is good.

131
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:10.900
Luigi Iannone: Great.

132
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:15.920
Peter Liu: Let's see.

133
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.150
Peter Liu: Oh, wait!

134
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.729
Peter Liu: Which screen you're looking at. You're looking at draft.

135
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.770
Luigi Iannone: The no. My picture in Utah.

136
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.020
Peter Liu: Oh, okay.

137
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:39.420
Peter Liu: okay, okay. So I didn't make a slide out of it. But I have created a draft. And I can explain.

138
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:45.550
Peter Liu: basically, this is a generic pot or abstract pot

139
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.019
Peter Liu: that we were we talked about in Dublin.

140
00:20:50.270 --> 00:21:08.919
Peter Liu: Basically why we kind of need this thing is because pot mechanisms. There is basically people could have different choices. Right? Like, we, we decided like, we want to do pot mostly if it's within a controlled limited domain.

141
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:22.119
Peter Liu: Very highly. Likely we're gonna use. You know, one choice. But in different domains, like, for example, like different systems or different countries of different operators.

142
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:28.240
Peter Liu: they might have different choices, is like different cipher tech sorry cipher suites.

143
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:39.240
Peter Liu: but in the end, so the Nazar actually want to build on top of rats, ideology and procedures.

144
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:48.900
Peter Liu: Basically. Why you want to use what? Why you want to have remote attestation procedures is because, like, despite the differences you know

145
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:53.510
Peter Liu: we still want to provide a unified.

146
00:21:53.550 --> 00:22:18.830
Peter Liu: you know. Procedure of delivering trustworthiness, you know, results apprisal results. So people could have different implementations. They could have different. You know different implementation details, but in the end they can price as the same. So the reason I want to put this draft into work is because.

147
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:34.759
Peter Liu: despite the different implementations, we're still, you know, when, when there's there are 2 different domains that want to collaborate and deliver a connectivity service when especially like 2 different operators.

148
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:41.979
Peter Liu: wants to cooperate. This is a this is a process of exchanging

149
00:22:42.651 --> 00:22:48.850
Peter Liu: trustworthiness, or or or does the other side have

150
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:53.799
Peter Liu: you know, adhered to what

151
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.119
Peter Liu: that has been promised to me

152
00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:08.420
Peter Liu: so essentially. If if there's 2 different operators, for example, China, Mobile, and Chinafonica, they may have different, you know choices.

153
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:15.772
Peter Liu: but when they collaborate and deliver a connectivity service, you know, the telephonica still wants to, you know.

154
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:26.180
Peter Liu: have some confidence that the path in the China mobiles domain is, is compliant

155
00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:38.289
Peter Liu: complies with the agreed path. So this is why generic pot may be necessary to help them to interoper, interoperate.

156
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:43.230
Peter Liu: So this draft actually, I kind of, despite

157
00:23:43.340 --> 00:24:05.059
Peter Liu: many different instances, I kind of described what a pot mechanism should be, what the you know requirements what are necessary roles. So basically, they have producers and verifiers. They are also decision-making points where verification results could lead to

158
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:14.190
Peter Liu: packet level processing decisions like drop or continue to forward or any other actions.

159
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:26.019
Peter Liu: and there could be different messages, there could be different. There are actually different conceptual messages like the input to compute a pu t

160
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:50.879
Peter Liu: tag, for example, the thumbprint of the IP header, the payload, or the ingress interface egress interface, the 5 tuple whatever. So this, these are the Inputs, and the output could be, you know, different ways of doing it. It could be attached to the Path packet as an in situ tag.

161
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.609
Peter Liu: and there could be like out of band messages.

162
00:24:54.310 --> 00:25:03.879
Peter Liu: And also we would need. These are 2 important things I want to address is that we're gonna need auxiliary information to compute

163
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:25.789
Peter Liu: pot tags there will be, we will needing some kind of keys or secret values to prevent forgery and replace. So there will be necessary auxiliary information or secret information to help us to compute a pot tag, and there should be verification references

164
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:30.680
Peter Liu: that is going to be used as an input for verification.

165
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:38.520
Peter Liu: For example, they could be like baselines of pots. They can be exactly the same to the expected pot.

166
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.500
Peter Liu: For example, like the Controller.

167
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:49.269
Peter Liu: would set up this reference. Baseline would set up this verification reference by computing all these kind of

168
00:25:49.290 --> 00:26:10.500
Peter Liu: references and then configure them through Netconf, young or any other control plane extensions or other configuration methods and send this verification baseline or reference directly to each verifier node.

169
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:31.890
Peter Liu: or they could be other, you know, distributed setup methods that's gonna use some dial test methods. I I know Diego is kind of interesting. This dial test method to to do the configurations I know mainly has a a Bgpls extension that would do this distributed

170
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.990
Peter Liu: configuration with a protocol extension

171
00:26:37.126 --> 00:26:50.660
Peter Liu: and then we have different calculation types to have different verification types. And also, I have some use cases for illustration. How how does that apply to the real use cases?

172
00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:56.660
Peter Liu: We could have different calculation types. We can have calculation, sorry, compute and replace.

173
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.589
Peter Liu: So eventually, this is just one data field, or we can concatenate

174
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:10.430
Peter Liu: for to keep a full record like they have, they could be like different pot tags that's gonna stack up

175
00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.740
Peter Liu: and be sent on the packet.

176
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:18.620
Peter Liu: and they could be like sent out of band. So I'm just listing out choices.

177
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:30.209
Peter Liu: so the verification also there could be like an end, verify or mid verify. So the difference is that the verifier, as we mentioned, could be at the end of the path.

178
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.650
Peter Liu: and only verifies the proof of transit tag only at the very end.

179
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:48.560
Peter Liu: or there could be, like intermediary sorry intermediate verifications that each each node in in inside of this path would do verification.

180
00:27:48.570 --> 00:28:03.050
Peter Liu: and then would do computation and then replace this tag so there could be like different ways. To verify it and verify obviously is more efficient. But the

181
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.459
Peter Liu: the the discovery of a deviation

182
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:26.450
Peter Liu: behavior would not be conducted in real time. But the mid verify would help something like the strict Srv. 6. To make sure that there will be no deviation because each individual node is basically control point, right?

183
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:34.790
Peter Liu: So there could be different verification types. Also, I'm kind of trying to list existing instances currently.

184
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:45.990
Peter Liu: that's provided in itf, that also should comply to this, this framework, and he eventually

185
00:28:46.888 --> 00:28:51.061
Peter Liu: you're right, and sorry. This was 11 o'clock in the night, so

186
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.680
Peter Liu: I might speak a little funny

187
00:28:54.910 --> 00:29:13.230
Peter Liu: also, I have listed some use case scenarios. That's gonna explain how these roles and the messages would connect and work together. So the I think the 2 most important use case we have right now is number one geofencing.

188
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:23.960
Peter Liu: to make sure, like some sensitive data from one domain or from one jurisdiction, does not escape to another.

189
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:48.039
Peter Liu: So in this case the border gateway here device is a verifier and is also a decision making point. That's gonna examine. Expect the pot tag and verifies it. And if this packet does not belong to a path that's going outwards like going outbound.

190
00:29:48.040 --> 00:30:00.171
Peter Liu: also, it's it should be staying inside of this jurisdiction, this this gateway should drop the packet or still relay the packet. But you know, keep

191
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.319
Peter Liu: a record.

192
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:09.959
Peter Liu: That's that's for the choice of the operator. But this is definitely a case that

193
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:14.750
Peter Liu: we want to put the verifier and decision-making point in the gateway.

194
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:25.060
Peter Liu: and the second is strict. Sr basic path. Validation in here, like we want to make sure, like the forwarding, must strictly adhere to the segment list.

195
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.759
Peter Liu: In this case each node is a verifier and also a decision-making point. So

196
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.520
Peter Liu: each node in this strict Srv. 6 path

197
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:45.059
Peter Liu: would verify. The carried pot, of course, is in situ carried, you know, extending some Ioem data field.

198
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.399
Peter Liu: and the node would verify this tag.

199
00:30:48.500 --> 00:31:04.540
Peter Liu: and then, if it complies to its verification reference, it passes verification, and then it would compute a new pot tag and replace it and pass it to the next next segment.

200
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:11.350
Peter Liu: So basically, these are the 2 different use cases that could be

201
00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:16.380
Peter Liu: more straightforwardly illustrated to the audience.

202
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:43.119
Peter Liu: And also there are also some security considerations and some cross domain. Interoperability, like there are many, you know, there are different ways for different domains or different systems to work each other just like the remote attestation. So there could be like passing down attestation results, basically just a result of telling

203
00:31:44.443 --> 00:31:54.709
Peter Liu: the the other domain that this pot is compliant, and I I endorse that I

204
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:55.869
Peter Liu: attest to that.

205
00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:04.439
Peter Liu: So this is like pass down results, or they could be like passed down details like, for example, they would pass down the the original

206
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:16.810
Peter Liu: for transit tag and auxiliary information, verification reference. Everything that's needed for the other side is due to verification. So there are different ways for the operators to choose from.

207
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.970
Peter Liu: and also there be other secure considerations.

208
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.350
Peter Liu: I think the time should be a little bit running out.

209
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:36.470
Peter Liu: right? It's just a different security considerations. It's gotta be. It's a work in progress that you gotta be more

210
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.350
Peter Liu: so. This is basically generic or abstract pot.

211
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.389
Luigi Iannone: Thanks, Peter, I have a couple of

212
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:57.179
Luigi Iannone: comments. Or, yeah. So when you started this this presentation, let's say it sounded like the focus was more about

213
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:06.970
Luigi Iannone: interoperability between different domains that use different type of pot. Okay.

214
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:14.860
Luigi Iannone: but this is one aspect of this thing, and this can be solved with a pot attestation in the sense that

215
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.429
Luigi Iannone: the the other domain doesn't need to know actually.

216
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:25.210
Luigi Iannone: which kind of pot did I use

217
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:32.130
Luigi Iannone: if I'm able to somehow provide an attestation that that my packets went through this list of

218
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.269
Luigi Iannone: nodes or segments, or whatever.

219
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.700
Luigi Iannone: This is one thing we started to discuss also in W.

220
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:44.460
Luigi Iannone: Now, the other thing is to have something generic that I can use

221
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.310
Luigi Iannone: if I have different protocols in the sense that I make an example.

222
00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.590
Luigi Iannone: Assuming I use segment routing to to steer the traffic.

223
00:33:55.810 --> 00:34:03.589
Luigi Iannone: I can use Srv 6. So ipv, 6, basically, or I can use Mpls.

224
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:11.559
Luigi Iannone: But the nice thing to to maybe be done as a abstract pot is the fact that

225
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:20.270
Luigi Iannone: doesn't matter. If I use Mpls or Srv. 6 the set of procedures

226
00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.889
Luigi Iannone: and operation that I need to do

227
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.920
Luigi Iannone: are equivalent. And at the end of the day I have, I

228
00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:30.599
Luigi Iannone: end of the path. I have a proof.

229
00:34:31.329 --> 00:34:36.439
Luigi Iannone: Okay, so and actually, when you went in the details of of the content of

230
00:34:36.569 --> 00:34:42.499
Luigi Iannone: yeah, this in this draft sounded more like you are working on this part of the problem.

231
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:47.189
Luigi Iannone: Which makes sense to me is just.

232
00:34:47.369 --> 00:34:50.709
Luigi Iannone: We need to clarify the the difference.

233
00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:56.199
Luigi Iannone: I would say, between the 2 aspects may end the side

234
00:34:57.079 --> 00:35:02.009
Luigi Iannone: which to work on, and whether or not they need to be in the same document.

235
00:35:02.029 --> 00:35:05.489
Luigi Iannone: And as our last very last comment.

236
00:35:06.029 --> 00:35:13.519
Luigi Iannone: When you talk about use cases because we have a document about use cases.

237
00:35:14.129 --> 00:35:23.109
Luigi Iannone: It looks to me that it's more suitable to use terminology like like verification models or something like that, because you are right.

238
00:35:23.129 --> 00:35:27.559
Luigi Iannone: I can make a verification at each node.

239
00:35:27.619 --> 00:35:31.889
Luigi Iannone: and each node may be a decider that say, Oh, this packet

240
00:35:31.919 --> 00:35:35.329
Luigi Iannone: is not going through the right path. So I throw it away.

241
00:35:35.459 --> 00:35:41.949
Luigi Iannone: or I verify only at the end of the path. So it's different verification models my opinion.

242
00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:44.189
Luigi Iannone: Okay? And and put.

243
00:35:44.229 --> 00:35:46.539
Luigi Iannone: The the use cases may be

244
00:35:46.669 --> 00:35:51.579
Luigi Iannone: in just in one document. It's not, I mean.

245
00:35:51.839 --> 00:35:53.689
Luigi Iannone: it's no big deal, in my opinion.

246
00:35:54.859 --> 00:36:00.429
Luigi Iannone: And Utah, you raise your hand.

247
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.090
Yutaka OIWA: Yes, interesting. But yeah, I feel this is

248
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:10.020
Yutaka OIWA: interesting approach. But for a use case I have

249
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:17.560
Yutaka OIWA: similar well, not similar concerns that not for actually, for at least for the

250
00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.000
Yutaka OIWA: the fencing. It will not work in this way, because so

251
00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:37.630
Yutaka OIWA: the for the fencing important point is the policy for the packet, not to the proof of the transit on the past, because in this figure it is not clear that verifier decision point belongs to the feature

252
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:46.219
Yutaka OIWA: organization and and actually, so

253
00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.809
Yutaka OIWA: drop point is not on this point for

254
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.419
Yutaka OIWA: proper geofencing. So maybe we can

255
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:59.380
Yutaka OIWA: do more analysis for use cases, but as a

256
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:09.490
Yutaka OIWA: maybe and other concern is outbound communication. Maybe maybe actually, my working area might be related to

257
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:10.593
Yutaka OIWA: that. But

258
00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:15.240
Yutaka OIWA: How we can coordinate it our action?

259
00:37:16.063 --> 00:37:19.869
Yutaka OIWA: Whether it really works depends on the

260
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.759
Yutaka OIWA: how we can design that in the reality. So

261
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.169
Yutaka OIWA: I think it's 1 of the promising

262
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:37.930
Yutaka OIWA: abstraction for the part of the protocol for connecting things. But it's have.

263
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.829
Yutaka OIWA: I feel, I still feel, that we have so many hidden assumptions

264
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:53.389
Yutaka OIWA: for the protocol. So we. Honestly, I cannot decide whether this will work or not, because it depends on the

265
00:37:54.070 --> 00:38:00.020
Yutaka OIWA: such hidden things. So. But I still I still think it's interesting.

266
00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.239
Peter Liu: Sorry, what kind of hidden assumptions.

267
00:38:05.905 --> 00:38:22.410
Yutaka OIWA: Because how how you said you can use sideband, for example, communication. But what kind of information are needed to agree on that, or something like that, it is not completely abstracted, so

268
00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:24.940
Yutaka OIWA: so.

269
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:29.810
Yutaka OIWA: Hmm.

270
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:39.099
Luigi Iannone: Maybe it's just a matter of more clarification of the hypothesis that are made for this work.

271
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.480
Luigi Iannone: Maybe.

272
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.160
Peter Liu: Okay, so what?

273
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.280
Peter Liu: June, important?

274
00:38:54.030 --> 00:39:01.440
Luigi Iannone: share the document on the mailing list so that we everybody can read and and reply with concrete feedback. I would say.

275
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.769
Luigi Iannone: I think it's a nice idea, but

276
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:14.239
Luigi Iannone: just personal opinion. But in order to have concrete and constructive feedback, just share the pointer on the mailing list, or directly

277
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.750
Luigi Iannone: the content as you like.

278
00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.290
Peter Liu: Yes. Okay.

279
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.940
Luigi Iannone: June.

280
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:28.780
Jun Zhang: Hello, so I have a question on the use case. The 1st case for the geofencing.

281
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:36.799
Jun Zhang: So in this case is you use pot to prevent some nodes, get inside this domain, or, to prevent it, goes out.

282
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.390
Peter Liu: Where it goes goes out.

283
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:49.910
Jun Zhang: So in which I mean that. So how you know that to prevent goes out? Because I think, okay, if we in the

284
00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:58.590
Jun Zhang: in the packet header. You have the other intermediate nodes that you want to go, and you check that. Some nodes are out of the

285
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:06.859
Jun Zhang: out of the the trust domain. And then you say that you cannot forward, or it's because here you see that if there's a

286
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:11.660
Jun Zhang: verification failure you will drop it. So it is, in which case.

287
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:26.889
Peter Liu: So for example, like here the you have node one and node 2, intersection a. And if the border gateway is a is a plan. Node 3.

288
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:28.200
Jun Zhang: Yes.

289
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.330
Peter Liu: And there's another node, 4 in the outside.

290
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.740
Peter Liu: Then it's a goal.

291
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:41.520
Peter Liu: right? It means the border gateway is in this path, and it's supposed to go outbound, otherwise.

292
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:57.780
Jun Zhang: You. You know, from the the head information. You already know that 4 is a certain node that this package want to go through. So in that case it's you will have the succeed in the verification, and then you decide to drop this packet right.

293
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:02.190
Peter Liu: You need verification before you make decisions.

294
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.700
Jun Zhang: So that we, when you

295
00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:24.909
Jun Zhang: do the verification of the pot, and it's a success. And then you said, Okay, because you contain some node that does not fit with the rules. So you dropped. But what if there's a verification failure? So you do not. There's something wrong in the pot, so you do not know whether it go out of the trust region or not.

296
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:36.369
Peter Liu: So if the verification fails, it means the gateway is not a supposed node on the path.

297
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.109
Peter Liu: and then you can make sure like this. This path has taken a wrong turn.

298
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:47.400
Peter Liu: and then you can decide to drop it to preserve confidentiality.

299
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:57.959
Jun Zhang: So in this case, when you mean that there's a fail in the application, is it does not fit the rules, or is there the wrong pot? Information.

300
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:05.590
Peter Liu: Both ways. Wrong pot means the wrong wrong behavior.

301
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:25.600
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah. So maybe for this use case, we should make some example configuration for how to say good

302
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:34.160
Yutaka OIWA: pot record. And so that the verifier can decide it can go outside.

303
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:48.830
Yutaka OIWA: Oh, failed Case, how the path pass is recorded and verify, I can decide

304
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:56.320
Yutaka OIWA: that should that device should drop the packet. So the

305
00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.069
Yutaka OIWA: actually, for for at least for this figure

306
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:07.750
Yutaka OIWA: setting, what verify has to know is not the pot

307
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.809
Yutaka OIWA: let go, but the policy for the packet, so that because

308
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:17.670
Yutaka OIWA: for viewpoint of the verifier and in the jurisdiction a.

309
00:43:19.057 --> 00:43:28.799
Yutaka OIWA: What he should they verify, trust the node one and node 2. So

310
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:36.839
Yutaka OIWA: in the same trust domain. So he don't actually need the pot for the geofencing. So

311
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:44.180
Yutaka OIWA: maybe we should have more concrete. Yeah, I know this.

312
00:43:45.177 --> 00:43:47.089
Yutaka OIWA: Proposal itself is

313
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:57.669
Yutaka OIWA: for the more absolute one. But for this, at least, for this figure, we should have a more concrete example for how we can detect

314
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.389
Yutaka OIWA: the bad packet and it correctly developed.

315
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.309
Yutaka OIWA: So I.

316
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.760
Luigi Iannone: I'll be, you mean adding a few examples. What happens in in an.

317
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.220
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah.

318
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.719
Luigi Iannone: Case, a toy toy case or something like that.

319
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:18.520
Luigi Iannone: Okay, okay. Man seems similar.

320
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.291
Luigi Iannone: Seems okay. I mean,

321
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:28.890
Yutaka OIWA: Might be good for the more how to say security, analysis, or

322
00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:38.890
Yutaka OIWA: protocol design. So we should have a more concrete image on how? What kind of pot is recorded in the good and bad case, and

323
00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:46.340
Yutaka OIWA: fair with Kang and Fairvie should decide the verification result.

324
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:52.150
Yutaka OIWA: We should have more analysis on that for a problem analysis.

325
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.539
Luigi Iannone: You may help. I mean, if you, if you

326
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:13.169
Luigi Iannone: share this on the mailing list, we can work more on this. So I mean you can even, I mean, submit this to the create a real draft and then share it on the mailing list, so that we have it also on the data tracker.

327
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:20.810
Luigi Iannone: So, and we can discuss for that on the mailing list. Is that right?

328
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.440
Peter Liu: Just drop a message on the list. Please.

329
00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:48.060
Luigi Iannone: Okay. So if you don't mind, I take back the sharing and

330
00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.220
Luigi Iannone: share my screen, I'll go back to the use lights.

331
00:45:55.850 --> 00:46:00.540
Luigi Iannone: So the next item in the agenda is the the

332
00:46:01.506 --> 00:46:08.240
Luigi Iannone: the Eiv statement. So in the 1st part of this slide, no, no.

333
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.510
Luigi Iannone: In the 1st half of this slide on the top.

334
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.349
Luigi Iannone: Oh, here we go.

335
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:21.300
Luigi Iannone: This is something that I took from the

336
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:30.630
Luigi Iannone: Ieb statement. The link is the very bottom of the of this slide. So basically, what it says is that.

337
00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.910
Luigi Iannone: the use of

338
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:44.229
Luigi Iannone: attestation shouldn't prevent open access. So, Michael, there is something you you would say, would like to say right away.

339
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:51.660
Michael Richardson: Well, I was very surprised that you even thought we had to engage against this. This is really about web browsers.

340
00:46:51.840 --> 00:47:00.019
Michael Richardson: The Iab statement is very poorly done, but your points at the bottom are are reasonable, but I don't even think we have to engage in it.

341
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:09.349
Luigi Iannone: I don't think we need any specific action except for one thing. This question has been raised.

342
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:11.890
Luigi Iannone: Okay, so we need an answer.

343
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:21.259
Luigi Iannone: And the answer that I propose is what you find on the second half of these slides. So

344
00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:39.189
Luigi Iannone: this NASA basically is kind of the scope. Large scope of NASA, not to be widely deployed in the open Internet, not to restrict access, etc. Etc. And just providing auditing tools.

345
00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:46.750
Michael Richardson: I think you could just make 1 1 point. Nazar is not about client attestation period.

346
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.850
Nancy: Right.

347
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.319
Luigi Iannone: Oh, yeah, it could be.

348
00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.180
Nancy: Beat me to the punch. Michael.

349
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:51.650
Michael Richardson: Yeah.

350
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:52.260
Nancy: Yeah.

351
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.659
Michael Richardson: The Iab was concerned about about browsers and smartphones.

352
00:47:58.050 --> 00:47:58.480
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

353
00:47:58.780 --> 00:47:59.320
Michael Richardson: Being attacked.

354
00:47:59.320 --> 00:47:59.940
Peter Liu: Okay.

355
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:07.470
Michael Richardson: And they did a very poor job, and they didn't consult any of the rats people before they used their wording, and Hannes helped them. But

356
00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:08.180
Michael Richardson: wow!

357
00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:13.540
Nancy: No, I mean all the chairs, including myself, is the rat's chair. We were all there.

358
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.730
Nancy: and the clarification was, but they didn't want to put a retraction.

359
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:18.570
Nancy: Yeah?

360
00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:19.790
Nancy: Realized?

361
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:20.870
Nancy: Yeah.

362
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:32.429
Luigi Iannone: So we just need to state somewhere that the master is not for clients. Okay, like Web Browser point is, where do we keep this statement because

363
00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:35.860
Luigi Iannone: the the question may may come back again later on.

364
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:37.390
Peter Liu: Hmm.

365
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:42.480
Nancy: I think, as long as you put it into the minutes of these meetings.

366
00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:44.529
Nancy: Oh, you think we'll be fine.

367
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:45.780
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

368
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.199
Luigi Iannone: Sounds good to me.

369
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.030
Luigi Iannone: That's very, very good to me.

370
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:54.989
Yutaka OIWA: Maybe so, therefore the answer we stood first.st

371
00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:04.050
Yutaka OIWA: It's not for the client at the session is a fast 1st item before openly seeing about opening accessible services.

372
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:10.990
Yutaka OIWA: That's a very important point. And also, still, we should.

373
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:17.019
Yutaka OIWA: I think we should keep these documents on the problem statement document.

374
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:27.539
Nancy: I think we need to be very crisp and tight on our charter.

375
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.189
Yutaka OIWA: And I think this will only deter from it.

376
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:33.110
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

377
00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.180
Peter Liu: Plus one.

378
00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:40.359
Luigi Iannone: Okay, the point will be in the minutes.

379
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.817
Luigi Iannone: Okay, moving forward.

380
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:51.649
Luigi Iannone: I was thinking to make a point a little bit on the documents that we have, and that the plans in the coming future.

381
00:49:52.464 --> 00:49:58.909
Luigi Iannone: We have the architecture and use case and requirements and terminology

382
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:04.870
Luigi Iannone: Now the terminology is expired. However.

383
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.479
Luigi Iannone: if we go quickly back to the.

384
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:21.310
Luigi Iannone: to the charter, at least as it is today, we, we stated our 1st document would be use cases, problem, statement and requirement.

385
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:25.410
Luigi Iannone: And so

386
00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:34.943
Luigi Iannone: I wonder if the terminology itself could be merged with the with the use case and and

387
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:40.229
Luigi Iannone: requirements dotted. So that in one place we have the problem

388
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:48.379
Luigi Iannone: which use cases is supposed to to solve their requirements and the overall terminology, so that everybody has a clear picture

389
00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:49.980
Luigi Iannone: from one document.

390
00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.949
Luigi Iannone: So that's a question. So

391
00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:59.320
Luigi Iannone: you prefer to keep it separated.

392
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.289
Peter Liu: No, no, I mean, I mean, we can. We can merge.

393
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:19.469
Peter Liu: There's actually similar comments, was from other ads. That's very, very helpful, and says, maybe it's a good idea to keep a very compact document just one, and explains everything. That's better than having many documents scattered everywhere.

394
00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:25.890
Luigi Iannone: So one action point could be to to try to produce one

395
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:30.810
Luigi Iannone: merger document out of these 2 and yeah.

396
00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:34.270
Nancy: But again, I think what I want to highlight is.

397
00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:35.510
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

398
00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:41.559
Nancy: I know we're working on these documents. But we really need to make sure that we have

399
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:46.269
Nancy: a crisp problem statement with a crisp charter

400
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:51.210
Nancy: to get to the working group. It's only until we have the working group that we can.

401
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.800
Peter Liu: Officially, work.

402
00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.710
Nancy: On these drafts.

403
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:57.010
Peter Liu: Right.

404
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:58.080
Luigi Iannone: That's

405
00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:07.680
Luigi Iannone: but don't you think that working at least on the problem statement document will allow us to better shape the problem and also put it in the charter.

406
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:14.640
Luigi Iannone: or you think should be the other way around working on the. And then we translate to the to the draft.

407
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:20.160
Nancy: Typically for the the groups that I've worked in. It's been the other way around.

408
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:26.179
Nancy: because we will end up spending a lot more time refining the problem statement.

409
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:30.290
Nancy: I mean, Michael can attest to this in the rats group.

410
00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.270
Nancy: We went through this with sacm

411
00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:40.520
Nancy: and it's more important to get the general notion of the problem statement and the scope

412
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.839
Nancy: that we want to focus on in the working group.

413
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.720
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

414
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:56.280
Luigi Iannone: So I'd maybe we skip the other slides. We go to the the chapter now the

415
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:08.539
Luigi Iannone: There are 2 things, in my opinion that we need to work on. And starting from this proposal, one is the fact that

416
00:53:09.077 --> 00:53:16.339
Luigi Iannone: we have to make clear that the routing now is just out of scope we do. Forwarding.

417
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.019
Luigi Iannone: then, the at some point we we.

418
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.610
Toerless: Ask you a question.

419
00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.680
Luigi Iannone: Yep, peace thoughtless, right.

420
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.573
Toerless: Right. Yes,

421
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.699
Luigi Iannone: Go ahead! Don.

422
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:26.750
Toerless: So the

423
00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:41.029
Toerless: if I want to use NASA to build secure routing. Then I would need the ability for routing protocol to leverage NASA proof of transit

424
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:46.940
Toerless: as a mean to validate that the routing protocol packets themselves.

425
00:53:48.377 --> 00:53:49.810
Toerless: Can be trusted.

426
00:53:50.775 --> 00:54:00.150
Toerless: So if that is not within scope, because you know, a routing protocol can be seen as a client. Then that would kind of be

427
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:01.360
Toerless: silly.

428
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:02.540
Toerless: I think.

429
00:54:05.785 --> 00:54:07.220
Luigi Iannone: Why.

430
00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:21.250
Toerless: Well, because I want to make sure that I can ensure that NASA makes it possible for routing protocol packets to have proof of transit.

431
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:25.990
Toerless: You don't need to spend specify, you know.

432
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:29.070
Michael Richardson: You. What you want is routing protocol security.

433
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:33.380
Michael Richardson: They don't transit mostly.

434
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:40.170
Michael Richardson: but what you need is security. Be of the routing. You need the routing protocol to be secured. Tarles, I think.

435
00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:49.999
Toerless: Yeah, but we we we have, you know, done all type of crappy things like setting the Ttl to 2, 54 to ensure that the package.

436
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.530
Michael Richardson: Sure.

437
00:54:50.530 --> 00:55:00.525
Toerless: Isn't a rerouted or so so kind of, instead being able to say, Hey, I'm using proof of transit as as a way to to ensure

438
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:01.860
Michael Richardson: You can do that.

439
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:10.320
Toerless: Right, but you know I'm I'm just wondering about the scope and what's you know permitted and not permitted to be to be done within us.

440
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:28.989
Luigi Iannone: But you you don't need to do it in Nasser. I mean, assuming that that NASA comes up with a proof of transparency tool, you give a list of points, or whatever the form will be, and gives you the tool to verify that the packet goes through that tool through that path right?

441
00:55:29.455 --> 00:55:39.640
Luigi Iannone: The fact that another routing protocol or another routing working group working on secure routing, use the tool

442
00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:45.930
Luigi Iannone: to validate the choice that has been made at the routing level. That's a different story.

443
00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:50.859
Luigi Iannone: and is not necessarily here that has to be solved. Actually.

444
00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:55.937
Toerless: Right? Right? So, but but okay, so let's let's generalize the thing right? So

445
00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:24.680
Toerless: how far away from something that can actually be used to solve a problem. Is NASA meant to be right? If if I'm not even allowed to have something that says on here is, you know how you would use NASA to secure routing protocol or secure any other type of application or kind of delivering just a component, and have to hope for somebody else to that for secure, for for an actual secure use solution, right?

446
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:30.127
Luigi Iannone: I wouldn't formulate the thing in that way. I would.

447
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:41.699
Luigi Iannone: from my understanding with the latest discussion is more that NASA is about verification, not securing by itself. So you can audit

448
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.500
Luigi Iannone: with. With the with NASA you can audit the path

449
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:52.369
Luigi Iannone: you can audit, the attributes and trustworthiness of the notes that are along.

450
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:56.569
Toerless: You're going into more details. That's that's that's not what my concern is.

451
00:56:56.610 --> 00:57:06.319
Toerless: My concern is to what extent can NASA only be called successful. If somebody else is doing things that we explicitly put out of scope.

452
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:07.320
Yutaka OIWA: Hmm.

453
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:11.290
Luigi Iannone: Tell me again, please.

454
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:22.540
Toerless: I'm saying I'm worried about making the scope of NASA so small that it becomes a library that you know can only be successful if other working groups are picking it up.

455
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:34.349
Toerless: I would like to see that there is a is a path to show some, you know, minimum, useful NASA space solution that can be done by NASA itself

456
00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:36.890
Toerless: without depending on other working groups.

457
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:39.889
Luigi Iannone: Okay. Now I see your point.

458
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:40.770
Yutaka OIWA: Thank you.

459
00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.545
Yutaka OIWA: And

460
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:53.659
Yutaka OIWA: yeah, it's a big problem. But I think the motivation and solution is not still not very lying. So

461
00:57:55.630 --> 00:58:01.990
Yutaka OIWA: in the motivational tech is to we have so many clients. But it's not clear that how

462
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:09.989
Yutaka OIWA: the assumed trust I don't understand the assumed trust model, so that

463
00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:18.249
Yutaka OIWA: if the verifier is on the mid pass and bus, how clients can trust the

464
00:58:19.031 --> 00:58:25.209
Yutaka OIWA: thing, or something like that. So we should more analysis on the use case.

465
00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:31.950
Yutaka OIWA: See the this, what the another, what? Actually, the

466
00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:41.269
Yutaka OIWA: what NASA solves is not. We're still very aligned with background and motivation. So.

467
00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.219
Luigi Iannone: So basically we have.

468
00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.440
Toerless: Right. I think

469
00:58:44.440 --> 00:59:00.600
Toerless: everybody who's thinking about specific solutions of NASA should be worried about whether or not you know they think that with a limited candidate, Charter, you'll be able to resolve other dependencies to to create the working solution.

470
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:24.240
Toerless: For example, I can't see you know how to get anything done in routing. Given how we, you know, tried to build a working group for secure routing that failed miserably because people were just going into all other directions, right? So having the ability to say. And here is, you know, a simple way for NASA to be applied to routing protocol packets to

471
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:29.189
Toerless: serve as a way to making that routing protocol secure itself.

472
00:59:29.701 --> 00:59:32.009
Toerless: Would be a very simple

473
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:46.409
Toerless: Validation method and saying, Okay, we have limited, you know, reference solution specifications for NASA with which NASA can be deployed successfully

474
00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.670
Toerless: without external dependencies.

475
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.350
Yutaka OIWA: No.

476
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:56.909
Luigi Iannone: This doesn't mean necessarily working on secure routing itself. We agree totally, because.

477
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:59.960
Toerless: I don't know what that term means. I don't know what that term means.

478
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:02.320
Luigi Iannone: Okay. But if I understand.

479
01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.240
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, yeah, you'll have really amazing.

480
01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.179
Luigi Iannone: About how to explain that. Why.

481
01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:14.210
Luigi Iannone: the outcome on us will be useful and used by orders. Right?

482
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:16.539
Luigi Iannone: That's the the point you did make.

483
01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:22.869
Toerless: Yeah. And I don't even know what secure routing is. Where does you know? Where? Where would that start?

484
01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:24.860
Luigi Iannone: Exactly, so.

485
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:30.480
Toerless: I don't know what that is. If somebody can point me to a specification that that would be great.

486
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:37.870
Toerless: because I don't know what it means to say we're not working on secure routing.

487
01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:40.850
Peter Liu: On!

488
01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:47.770
Luigi Iannone: I would define it like we. We will not extend any routing protocol in order to embed anything.

489
01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:58.930
Luigi Iannone: Okay? And instead making the hypothesis that we have a path, and we want to verify probability of the path and the fact that the packets go through that path

490
01:00:59.110 --> 01:00:59.620
Luigi Iannone: no.

491
01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:01.529
Toerless: If I'm saying.

492
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:02.140
Luigi Iannone: To your point.

493
01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:07.810
Toerless: Defining a NASA solution document that basically says how to

494
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:21.920
Toerless: apply. Let's say we're having NASA being Ipv 6 extension header. Ultimately, right? How to apply that to routing protocol packets, to give them a level of NASA security or trustworthiness.

495
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:27.939
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, yeah, I was about to say that how the others can use Nasser

496
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:36.639
Luigi Iannone: doesn't necessarily mean to defend the details doesn't necessarily mean to work on any routing.

497
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.849
Toerless: Well, I mean, I think I think the question, of course, is.

498
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:47.099
Luigi Iannone: There is also there is also the reason that that this is one of the feedback we received during the both

499
01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:52.849
Luigi Iannone: because the fact that routing, secure routing is a huge thing and will not.

500
01:01:52.890 --> 01:02:00.789
Luigi Iannone: I mean, not free. I think it's too big. If we put that in scope, we are boiling the ocean.

501
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.520
Yutaka OIWA: So so Troy.

502
01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.040
Toerless: Then.

503
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:04.560
Peter Liu: For us.

504
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:04.815
Toerless: Oh!

505
01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.680
Peter Liu: Please.

506
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:12.330
Peter Liu: I mean, I'm thinking.

507
01:02:12.941 --> 01:02:23.490
Peter Liu: I mean, sorry I'm thinking towards, are you thinking about specific protocol extensions that helps you? Do you want to see specific protocol extensions

508
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:25.280
Peter Liu: to be specified.

509
01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:45.790
Toerless: Well, very broadly speaking, I would like to be able to, you know, have any form of reference solution that can be, you know, built without external dependencies and without necessarily saying, Oh, there is a magical NASA controller that solves all the problems we weren't allowed to standardize.

510
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.540
Luigi Iannone: Fair enough.

511
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:51.470
Toerless: That's that's that's my worry that I have.

512
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:54.559
Luigi Iannone: Work on that fair enough point taken.

513
01:02:54.780 --> 01:03:06.249
Toerless: If we want to have something that self orchestrates itself to use NASA as opposed to outsourcing everything to a magical NASA controller.

514
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.649
Toerless: what's the minimum solution. We can think of. What would it do.

515
01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:11.030
Peter Liu: Right, right.

516
01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:14.610
Yutaka OIWA: So.

517
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:25.299
Toerless: We can specify a solution document that gives sufficiently enough details about what a NASA controller should do, so that you can build a solution. That's fine as well.

518
01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:31.129
Toerless: right? I'm obviously more for the self orchestration than you know. External orchestration. But you know

519
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:34.680
Toerless: I've written Rfcs, too, that depend on the magical controller.

520
01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.369
Toerless: But you know, at least

521
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:46.220
Toerless: we need to specify sufficient, you know, mechanisms to to so so that people can build a working solution.

522
01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:54.249
Toerless: Any any reference solution, not for all the use cases, but for one or 2 reference use cases.

523
01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:56.590
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

524
01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:07.140
Toerless: Right. And I would say ideally, one solution with a controller and one self orchestrating solution, that you know, whatever you know

525
01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:10.620
Toerless: would be the opposite approach.

526
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:17.059
Yutaka OIWA: And so yeah, use case is very important. And

527
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.300
Yutaka OIWA: and also this is a kind of security thing. So

528
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:32.750
Yutaka OIWA: I, who are who are actually pass this. I think this is already mentioned in the

529
01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:42.540
Yutaka OIWA: Australia. So the it's not clear how the client, how much clients.

530
01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.599
Yutaka OIWA: So that's the

531
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:55.780
Yutaka OIWA: Limited Domain service. If that's that's a i think that's a critical question not yet addressed in the current scope, because if

532
01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.110
Yutaka OIWA: clients received a low verification result. Clients

533
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:07.870
Yutaka OIWA: needs to know how they can trust the verification result that.

534
01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:13.300
Yutaka OIWA: And if grants trust the Meta thing like

535
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:22.300
Yutaka OIWA: server located, or something like that, it's almost equivalent to trust the server. So they don't need pot. So

536
01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:28.529
Yutaka OIWA: so that's why saying yeah for Peter that we should.

537
01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:32.679
Yutaka OIWA: So something linear image of the pot

538
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:41.730
Yutaka OIWA: results clients receive and what? How much extent clients must blindly to last the

539
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:46.660
Yutaka OIWA: verify or something like that. So and it's

540
01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:58.490
Yutaka OIWA: yeah for a protocol level. It can be, have many, many variations. But for at least one example you must. We must have a

541
01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.454
Yutaka OIWA: a very how to say

542
01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:07.710
Yutaka OIWA: promising example. For that. We I unfortunately, I don't.

543
01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:22.040
Yutaka OIWA: They see such example in the things. And that's why, actually, I strongly proposing working for multiple administrative control

544
01:06:22.908 --> 01:06:27.039
Yutaka OIWA: orchestration. It's it has actually the

545
01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.303
Yutaka OIWA: pretty a use case. And

546
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:37.200
Yutaka OIWA: and I am trying to document it yet. But we have very clear use case, and we have we?

547
01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:40.359
Yutaka OIWA: I am attending here because we have a client

548
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:45.400
Yutaka OIWA: government client, and we have an intention to implement that.

549
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:56.060
Yutaka OIWA: So I want to. I, yeah, I want to have an image for a pot, but I

550
01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:06.540
Yutaka OIWA: cannot imagine the implementation still cannot have an implementation image for the verifier and the tester, for so.

551
01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:17.379
Yutaka OIWA: without having such image, we cannot decide whether this can be useful or not, and with that clear image I really afraid that second book will not

552
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.970
Yutaka OIWA: concluded successfully.

553
01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:30.330
Luigi Iannone: Okay, there is the new upcoming draft from Peter that can enlight you, and then you can help him clarify the

554
01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:37.630
Luigi Iannone: the idea there. In the meantime, what I what I gather is the fact that we need to clarify.

555
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:40.110
Luigi Iannone: Who will use NASA.

556
01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:40.640
Yutaka OIWA: Yep.

557
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.929
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, yeah, as totally said, we.

558
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:47.070
Luigi Iannone: we need to clarify the dependencies. Yeah.

559
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.860
Luigi Iannone: And this machine be in the chat

560
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:52.640
Luigi Iannone: in order to to make sure that the

561
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:56.969
Luigi Iannone: let's say that others will use the

562
01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.470
Luigi Iannone: the outcome of the of master.

563
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.290
Luigi Iannone: Okay?

564
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:06.380
Luigi Iannone: And so this is a an important point.

565
01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:13.969
Toerless: So in anima, for example, we had 2 informational Rfc. As part of the charter, which were reference use cases.

566
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.750
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

567
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:22.070
Toerless: So so just just a practical example. So one for NASA could, for example, be, you know.

568
01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:34.195
Toerless: 3rd party audit, right? So the banking use case right where you, you basically need to have the full stack in the packet header, which I think is completely, you know,

569
01:08:34.620 --> 01:09:03.009
Toerless: too much overhead. But you can motivate it by, you know, at the edge of the network, close to the you know clients. It's an auditing device that is auditing these these tracks. It doesn't have it cannot get into the network. It cannot do anything, hop by hop. It can only sit on the client side on the edge, and it's auditing and and validating that the you know, the proof of transit for the whole path is compliance with regulations.

570
01:09:04.118 --> 01:09:10.240
Yutaka OIWA: That's interesting. It's also a very interesting use case for

571
01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:16.076
Yutaka OIWA: what I mentioned in the doubling, paying

572
01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:25.220
Yutaka OIWA: verification is done. So Peter mainly mentioned in transit verification.

573
01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:32.420
Yutaka OIWA: And I said pot might, Lisa, verifying the pot on time is

574
01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:41.929
Yutaka OIWA: not the easy thing. But for that thing. Maybe it's it's very interesting, because the purpose is to find hes afterwards.

575
01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:49.190
Yutaka OIWA: So yeah, a 3rd party auditing might be useful for knowing, not going where. So

576
01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:54.900
Yutaka OIWA: it's I I really appreciate that example.

577
01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:01.349
Luigi Iannone: Very good. We we are 1 min over time.

578
01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:08.950
Luigi Iannone: so there are very good points that have been raised. I will try to quickly produce minutes

579
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.650
Luigi Iannone: so that we can continue the

580
01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:15.150
Luigi Iannone: the discussion of the mail on the mailing list.

581
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:23.690
Luigi Iannone: And actually just a reminder, we will have another intermeeting

582
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:32.320
Luigi Iannone: or whatever you want to call it, the 11th of December in a different time.

583
01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.160
Luigi Iannone: This time it will be harder for the European.

584
01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:39.849
Luigi Iannone: We need to wake up early in the morning.

585
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:49.929
Luigi Iannone: but will be nicer from people in Asia and a little bit early evening, let's say

586
01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:53.640
Luigi Iannone: late afternoon, early evening for for people in us.

587
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.770
Luigi Iannone: North America. Okay, so

588
01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:06.379
Luigi Iannone: unless you have any very quick last comment, I would say that we call it a day if we

589
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.270
Luigi Iannone: we end the meeting here.

590
01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.219
Peter Liu: Thank you very much.

591
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:16.540
Yutaka OIWA: Thank you very much.

592
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:19.759
Luigi Iannone: Okay, thank you. Everybody for for the nice discussion.

593
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:23.180
Luigi Iannone: Talk to you on the mailing list, and we meet again in 2 weeks.

594
01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.440
Luigi Iannone: Yes, bye-bye.

595
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.200
Peter Liu: Thank you.

596
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.429
Yutaka OIWA: Bye, bye. Thank you.

597
01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.620
Jun Zhang: Hi.
