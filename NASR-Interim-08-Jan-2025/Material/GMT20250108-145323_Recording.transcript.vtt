00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.350
Luigi Iannone: Hello!

2
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.709
Yutaka OIWA: Hello! Can you hear me?

3
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.890
Michael Richardson: Yes. Can you hear me?

4
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.920
Nancy: Happy New Year.

5
00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:34.469
Luigi Iannone: Happy New Year.

6
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:42.919
Luigi Iannone: Wait just one or one more minute. Then we can start, okay.

7
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.780
Yutaka OIWA: To our exchanged in this slide.

8
00:09:16.443 --> 00:09:19.409
Luigi Iannone: We can like that when we.

9
00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:20.540
Yutaka OIWA: We speak.

10
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.026
Luigi Iannone: About the naming good observer.

11
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.238
Yutaka OIWA: Wow, also, s is, see.

12
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.449
Luigi Iannone: Okay, maybe we can start

13
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.690
Luigi Iannone: Here we go.

14
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.830
Luigi Iannone: Welcome, everybody. This is the our 1st meeting this year. So again, Happy New Year to everyone.

15
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:16.810
Luigi Iannone: we have a relatively simple agenda. Okay? The main topic today will be the charter in order to make progress.

16
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:24.559
Luigi Iannone: since next week will be the deadline for the both request, and you know this will be our second request.

17
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.750
Luigi Iannone: So we have to go for a working room for me both.

18
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.599
Luigi Iannone: and we have to be ready. Okay.

19
00:10:31.348 --> 00:10:39.240
Luigi Iannone: and then we can discuss a little bit on the new naming. There was some discussion on the mailing list. So with several proposals.

20
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.250
Luigi Iannone: and depend on on the time, if there is still time, there is mailing chain

21
00:10:45.921 --> 00:10:53.920
Luigi Iannone: that offered to present the progress on the service model. And there was also a recent email from Hank

22
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.000
Luigi Iannone: about the conceptual message proper in rats

23
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:08.290
Luigi Iannone: that he thinks is can fit in can be used in NASA. Okay? So if time is allowed, we will. We will end up with these presentations.

24
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.419
Luigi Iannone: Okay, other than that.

25
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:19.419
Luigi Iannone: Do you have any comment or anything to add to the minutes we shared for the last interim.

26
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:31.820
Luigi Iannone: Apparently not so I. I go directly to the, to the chapter. So

27
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:44.489
Luigi Iannone: since the last interim meeting. I wanted a little bit, just the the info sentences that did at the beginning of the the charter which

28
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:49.680
Luigi Iannone: you can see in this slide. The the changes. So before there was a

29
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.759
Luigi Iannone: simple paragraph with lines, I added a little bit

30
00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.379
Luigi Iannone: of more context than to what what we

31
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.830
Luigi Iannone: we want to do. And what are the the limitation that we we have today?

32
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.650
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

33
00:12:08.233 --> 00:12:10.100
Yutaka OIWA: Can I have some comment?

34
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.519
Luigi Iannone: Sure. That's why we.

35
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:34.290
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, yeah, that's good. But we are using. We are on the 1st sentence we are using, but not fasting in some sense, because we are always using encryption. So communication communicating something like that. So

36
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:44.650
Yutaka OIWA: the how to say we, maybe it's for me it's better. Don't use trust in this paragraph before talking about encryption

37
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.049
Yutaka OIWA: concept is agreed. So just a ticket, separate proposal.

38
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.039
Luigi Iannone: You say something like this.

39
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.089
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah, that may be confusing.

40
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.379
Luigi Iannone: Avoid trust.

41
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.650
Luigi Iannone: Single blindly, use.

42
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.440
Yutaka OIWA: Use. Yeah, that that's true. So

43
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.110
Yutaka OIWA: Theta are not trusted. They blindly use Spanish.

44
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.260
Luigi Iannone: I, see.

45
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:26.770
Nancy: Luigi. I started doing editing more on the request, but it's part of the charter blindly also has connotations.

46
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.120
Nancy: So I actually liked.

47
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.980
Nancy: Personally, I prefer a shorter Crispr. So I was trying to understand why

48
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.510
Nancy: we elaborated from the before to the now.

49
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:48.772
Luigi Iannone: That. That's I explained that that was my initiative.

50
00:13:50.700 --> 00:14:01.819
Luigi Iannone: in my opinion, I wanted to make clear a little bit. What? What are the limitations that we have? So that that right away, we, we have a context. So the fact

51
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:22.587
Luigi Iannone: and my idea was the fact that applications. Or anyway, we we use pass in a certain way, maybe blindly, is not the right term. It's just that we we take whatever the control plane gives us and we use it. But we don't have a

52
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:34.749
Luigi Iannone: explicit way to to explore the the attributes, the the properties of the past, except for

53
00:14:35.385 --> 00:14:47.239
Luigi Iannone: things like very simple, like like throughput latency, something like that. And that is the gap where where Nasser is positioning.

54
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.870
Luigi Iannone: That was my main idea.

55
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:55.869
Nancy: So if I right. So if I were to decompose this, I mean.

56
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:05.049
Nancy: there's still algorithms. So the way I would look at it is from an evolutionary path for the technology.

57
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:13.980
Nancy: Security was not considered. However, in order for the Internet to work, you must provide a performant

58
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:24.910
Nancy: right performance protocols for routers. I'm just picking routers now and so performant implied that we needed to

59
00:15:25.778 --> 00:15:29.900
Nancy: be efficient vis-a-vis. The latency throughput congestion.

60
00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:33.129
Nancy: scalability could be another one.

61
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.960
Nancy: But now, with the recent attacks, and somewhere you you had. I'm looking more at the top one.

62
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:56.609
Nancy: We've included things like confidentiality, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for the data plane but with increasing attacks

63
00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.479
Nancy: we require more of not just the protection of the data.

64
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:09.880
Nancy: But and now I'm looking at your second one, and I'm harping on the word audit.

65
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.380
Nancy: Is it that we need auditing? Is it that we need visibility?

66
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.439
Nancy: Is it that we need enforcement

67
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:29.079
Nancy: to me? These 3 things can be solved in subtly different ways, or we could do it in a single method. But all of this to me goes to

68
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:40.370
Nancy: what we're talking about is if we're talking about enforcement from a routing forwarding

69
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:50.570
Nancy: position or from an auditing and visibility, meaning, if an operator

70
00:16:50.710 --> 00:17:01.310
Nancy: or the owner of a deployment wants to ensure that the path that's taken is using

71
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.149
Nancy: network nodes that are deemed to be compliant.

72
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.499
Nancy: compliant to a set of claims.

73
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.120
Nancy: Then to me, that's the next step of an evolution.

74
00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.289
Nancy: So it's not like

75
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:24.749
Nancy: what's been happening is really bad. It's that we're needing to react to the realities of

76
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:30.269
Nancy: the attack. Surface having grown, does that make sense? Yeah.

77
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:44.657
Luigi Iannone: Yes, a a couple of comments from my side. You started with the the word Internet. I would avoid that because we are not going to for something. Internet wide. So

78
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.100
Nancy: And so.

79
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.920
Luigi Iannone: But I.

80
00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.569
Nancy: Go ahead, Luigi, go ahead. Sorry.

81
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.579
Luigi Iannone: The last part of of what you say that the compliance is is exactly

82
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:11.385
Luigi Iannone: I think, what what we are focusing on the fact that we want to use a pass, that that where the the network elements are compliant to a set of claims that is nicely formulated,

83
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:23.979
Luigi Iannone: a a little bit concerned about the word enforcement. Because if we want to enforce something, then we need to have an impact on the control plane, which means routing, which is something

84
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:30.780
Luigi Iannone: we we don't want now we we, as far as I'm my, is my understanding is

85
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.060
Luigi Iannone: the console thing. So the routing give. Give us a set of pass.

86
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:45.209
Luigi Iannone: and we want a tool to verify whether or not these paths are compliant to a set of claims. As you nicely stated.

87
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.620
Luigi Iannone: once we have that we choose one or several.

88
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.490
Luigi Iannone: I mean to send the traffic.

89
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:59.350
Luigi Iannone: and we want to approve that our actual traffic went through the pass.

90
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:07.029
Luigi Iannone: or several paths that we selected, because they they're compliant with our claims.

91
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.262
Nancy: Okay. So I use the word.

92
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.398
Nancy: sorry, Michael. I'm too too slow. Typing.

93
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.429
Nancy: I also didn't like the notion of saying Internet architecture.

94
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.380
Nancy: Right?

95
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:38.049
Nancy: So I actually preferred the previous motivation, because to me it was not that it's perfect, but it was simpler.

96
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.510
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

97
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.840
Nancy: And it went to the point of

98
00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.310
Nancy: the evolution is, we're seeing an increased number of attacks

99
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.560
Nancy: that now go to not just

100
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.330
Nancy: the need to protect the data traffic, but to also ensure that

101
00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:03.949
Nancy: the nodes along. And now I'll I'll use my terminology. The nodes in a network deployment

102
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.680
Nancy: right? And we can argue, customer could be

103
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:15.529
Nancy: an enterprise. Customer could be a service provider providing that service. But but in the notion of

104
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:25.919
Nancy: how the data traffic goes from point A to Point B, that that network deployment

105
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.620
Nancy: abides by a certain set of compliance.

106
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:43.740
Nancy: we can leave the enforcement absolutely. I agree with you. Enforcement is not in scope here. And again it goes to the How do we provide the right mechanisms by at least

107
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:54.300
Nancy: ensuring that there's some visibility or auditability that the nodes that are being used are, and

108
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.209
Nancy: I wouldn't use the word trust. Either I might use the word.

109
00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:58.650
Luigi Iannone: Agreed.

110
00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.710
Nancy: Client right

111
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.949
Nancy: To a set of of claims.

112
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.509
Peter Liu: I agree to that.

113
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:21.849
Luigi Iannone: Me, too. I mean, we can simply roll back and simplify again, and and use the your wording.

114
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:29.580
Nancy: So I apologize. I started wordsmithing. But my system crashed.

115
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.779
Nancy: Anyway, I can try and offer a rewording.

116
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.790
Nancy: Later. Yes.

117
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.270
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

118
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.050
Peter Liu: Thank you, Nancy.

119
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.356
Luigi Iannone: Okay. So in the

120
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.480
Luigi Iannone: Next part was the the let's say the the

121
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.689
Luigi Iannone: central part of the motivation and the ground

122
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.730
Luigi Iannone: which I proposed a pull request.

123
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:10.210
Luigi Iannone: The main thing is actually to avoid clients and use customers. Why that? Because to avoid

124
00:22:11.715 --> 00:22:17.950
Luigi Iannone: confusing clients like a web client or yeah, the

125
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.220
Luigi Iannone: I also sansa glide.

126
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.490
Nancy: Right. I also had a question on customers.

127
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.800
Luigi Iannone: Please.

128
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.979
Nancy: I would just leave it out with.

129
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.269
Nancy: I would still use the mechanical something like

130
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.150
Nancy: network deployments.

131
00:22:54.810 --> 00:23:03.548
Nancy: Network deployments today require elevate security. Privacy. Right?

132
00:23:08.525 --> 00:23:12.970
Nancy: beyond the right. The data plane.

133
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.860
Nancy: Because customer

134
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.540
Luigi Iannone: Do.

135
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:40.849
Nancy: There's very different profiles at Cisco. We use personas. Sorry. So I was, gonna say, persona, so

136
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:49.369
Nancy: is a customer much like I had the same question for clients, right is a customer.

137
00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.679
Nancy: A Ciso is a customer, the network administrator.

138
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.640
Nancy: Is it the secops?

139
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.140
Nancy: Is it the actual user.

140
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.409
Luigi Iannone: Yes.

141
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.380
Nancy: See what I mean.

142
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.549
Yutaka OIWA: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

143
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.659
Luigi Iannone: I see, I see. For me it was just

144
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.510
Luigi Iannone: The idea was, we have a the nasser service. So

145
00:24:17.326 --> 00:24:25.039
Luigi Iannone: the customer is whoever buys the service in a certain way. Now, is it too generic? I may agree?

146
00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:30.249
Luigi Iannone: We can use certainly use something like network deployments.

147
00:24:30.958 --> 00:24:38.679
Luigi Iannone: Not sure network deployments works in all of the sentences, but we can rephrase, I mean, and

148
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.030
Luigi Iannone: it's fine.

149
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:53.550
Yutaka OIWA: Oh, maybe we have to mixed issue here. So I I if I if raise the Nancy's comments so

150
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:05.540
Yutaka OIWA: In this sentence it introduced both how to say the problem statement and also

151
00:25:06.912 --> 00:25:11.249
Yutaka OIWA: implicitly introducing Grant's taba tabas model.

152
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:17.730
Yutaka OIWA: So maybe the bottom half, maybe depending on the

153
00:25:19.183 --> 00:25:25.599
Yutaka OIWA: from the second clients. Customers like line 7 or 8 line 8

154
00:25:26.915 --> 00:25:36.659
Yutaka OIWA: is talking, depending on the current server model service model. But the fast before that is more generic

155
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.360
Yutaka OIWA: can be described in generic way. So if we change the customers to the network deployment or something like that, the latter half.

156
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:53.559
Yutaka OIWA: yeah, might need some rearrangement to move moves to moderator paragraph, or something like that.

157
00:25:55.599 --> 00:26:15.749
Peter Liu: Sorry if I may jump in I kind of drafted this paragraph before. So the the client that I you know, you know I wanted to refer to is actually very simple. Use case a a connectivity service offered by the the operators to.

158
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:34.160
Peter Liu: for example, business enterprises between, you know, campuses. So they want this. You know, business oriented connectivity service. So in this case the clients are just the companies that receive this connectivity service. So I think

159
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:43.697
Nancy: So so, Peter, in a more general sense, and I apologize for cutting people off.

160
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:51.679
Nancy: I think in this instance, what we're talking about is the administrators

161
00:26:52.050 --> 00:27:06.660
Nancy: of a service, because it's not just operators. It could be. And that's why I was saying right, is it a network administrator? Is it a Ciso, is it? But I think what we're all agreeing is that in general

162
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:16.780
Nancy: there is a requirement that when they light up

163
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:23.046
Nancy: and sorry, I still keep harping to when they light up their network deployment.

164
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:29.639
Nancy: whether it's through an operator or not. They have requirements such that

165
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:39.530
Nancy: they want to ensure that the devices that are providing that connectivity have the

166
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:48.199
Nancy: the comply. And I'm using compliance markers here. But Peter, putting the word that you have here right?

167
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:58.380
Nancy: That the nodes have the latest security updates have, you know, past integrity checks and so on.

168
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.260
Nancy: But again, right? That they pass a certain set of of claims.

169
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.900
Peter Liu: Yes, security attributes. Yes.

170
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.860
Nancy: Correct.

171
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:20.659
Nancy: So I don't know that, you know, this goes specifically to a service provider use case. But I think

172
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:27.130
Nancy: from a charter perspective, I don't think we want a solution just for service providers.

173
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:41.769
Nancy: and I'm just looking at your last sentence there. Accordingly, operators should provide verifiable proofs. Right? It's not operators. It's

174
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:56.899
Nancy: the service or the solution needs to enable the ability to provide these sets of opticians.

175
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:06.359
Peter Liu: So. So you're suggesting to change the word operator to service, general service provider.

176
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.842
Yutaka OIWA: Oh, I think no.

177
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.460
Luigi Iannone: Just service.

178
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.180
Peter Liu: Okay.

179
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.300
Peter Liu: Yeah.

180
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:56.589
Luigi Iannone: So we we yeah, we replace customer with something like network deployment

181
00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:03.249
Luigi Iannone: operators with service. And we need to rearrange a little bit

182
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.660
Luigi Iannone: the sentences in order to have the.

183
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:15.546
Nancy: Yes, I I really was. I apologize. I was like rewriting stuff.

184
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.239
Nancy: which I've lost, but I can recover it.

185
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.100
Peter Liu: Oh!

186
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.810
Nancy: And I'm.

187
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.079
Peter Liu: Yeah, that would be very appreciated. Thanks.

188
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.220
Nancy: I don't want to.

189
00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:25.670
Luigi Iannone: Nice.

190
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:39.269
Luigi Iannone: So I don't have more on the slides, but we can go on the directly on the charter.

191
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.750
Luigi Iannone: So this is the the the text.

192
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.609
Yutaka OIWA: We're still with the class here.

193
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:55.554
Luigi Iannone: So what we have then, is the the goals and the scope which should work a little bit on this part.

194
00:30:57.458 --> 00:31:03.520
Luigi Iannone: I'm not sure we need the out of Scope section of if we need it. I would put it later on.

195
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:12.570
Luigi Iannone: and I'm not sure we need this paragraph. If we we have this part here at the end.

196
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.619
Nancy: That is correct.

197
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:25.189
Luigi Iannone: So I would copies and opinions whether or not we should have an out of scope

198
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.880
Luigi Iannone: section. Let's call it that way or list

199
00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.250
Yutaka OIWA: Hmm.

200
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:37.640
Peter Liu: Right.

201
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:48.590
Luigi Iannone: Should we? Should we put here in the charter explicitly, that the autoscope part is doubting, we have to face it somehow.

202
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.410
Luigi Iannone: The integrity and this stuff like here and we

203
00:31:54.270 --> 00:32:02.719
Luigi Iannone: in the previous boss we received in the chat. They discussed a little bit on the proof of non-transit.

204
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:09.070
Luigi Iannone: and John scatter also raised the same question when I presented in partner G.

205
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.540
Luigi Iannone: So if we.

206
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:21.050
Luigi Iannone: if we keep the out of scope part, we, we could mention also the the fact that yeah.

207
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:28.180
Luigi Iannone: we will not work of the on the proof of non-transit. But because, yeah.

208
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.170
Luigi Iannone: it's difficult to say is a solvable problem.

209
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:40.210
Luigi Iannone: So we're gonna waste time on working on that. And if it is solvable, so only

210
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:46.299
Luigi Iannone: from my understanding, at least my knowledge only in specific cases and deployments.

211
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:54.339
Luigi Iannone: It's hard to to find a generic framework of proof of non-transit, so I would some leave it.

212
00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:05.310
Luigi Iannone: Death on the counter side. Still in the last in the previous both

213
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:11.480
Luigi Iannone: there was a in the chat. They mentioned the fact to have a threat model.

214
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.660
Luigi Iannone: so we may want to somehow

215
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:21.890
Luigi Iannone: state that either in one of the documents that we have both items here.

216
00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:28.519
Luigi Iannone: we will present the threat model, or we'll have an explicit document on the threat model

217
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:31.409
Luigi Iannone: in order to to

218
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:40.350
Luigi Iannone: be rigorous on what we are able to protect and what we are able not to protect.

219
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.429
Luigi Iannone: Okay, what is covered by NASA, what is not covered, so

220
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.730
Luigi Iannone: especially for the proof of transit.

221
00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.969
Yutaka OIWA: I agree we need some document for that.

222
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.900
Yutaka OIWA: and I afraid we are not well understand.

223
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:17.459
Yutaka OIWA: No one understood the true street model for this problem. So in the chatter. So you wrote, we wrote.

224
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:26.950
Yutaka OIWA: we wrote that we cannot accept the simple encryption nowadays. But but

225
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.639
Yutaka OIWA: And

226
00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:39.139
Yutaka OIWA: my concern was that that is not very backed up by some facts or something like that. So we need to discuss.

227
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.610
Yutaka OIWA: or a survey that's right there.

228
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.839
Yutaka OIWA: so sweet when they are nices, or something like that.

229
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:52.489
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

230
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.449
Peter Liu: So.

231
00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:06.850
Peter Liu: so, so regarding the threat model. Because we're more like, you know, another direction from. So we we are not looking for, you know, attack services or looking for, you know.

232
00:35:07.481 --> 00:35:14.709
Peter Liu: Vulnerabilities. We're actually doing it in in that the other way to, you know, to show that there's

233
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:23.589
Peter Liu: you know not. We're not looking for vulnerabilities, but we are building trust from, you know, rats based.

234
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:31.769
Yutaka OIWA: That's not true. So by existence of the 3 model we can

235
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:45.659
Yutaka OIWA: counter majors like based on those that based on that. So treat, mother is just a list of how to say bug based vulnerability or something like that. So

236
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:59.630
Yutaka OIWA: the fleet model is a more generic than applicable for our cases. Of course, we are not doing the how to say the vulnerability or software, something like that.

237
00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:11.029
Luigi Iannone: I think the point is not to interpret threat, model, like what are the vulnerabilities, but later lay out what

238
00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:16.429
Luigi Iannone: we protect like for the proof of transit. What? What exactly can we prove?

239
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.439
Luigi Iannone: Okay, and what cannot be proved, at least with the solution the nasser will

240
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:29.159
Luigi Iannone: we come up with is just that no, it's he's he's.

241
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:39.000
Yutaka OIWA: But still we need some straight model that this thing only that solved the solutions are not enough for

242
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.530
Yutaka OIWA: security consideration, purpose. So

243
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:59.550
Yutaka OIWA: so we need some model for the network operation, assuming some kind of, I'd say, not by not

244
00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:03.150
Yutaka OIWA: not a bug, but attack surfaces

245
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:12.560
Yutaka OIWA: like a traffic analysis or something like that, or log route, or something like that, and for for which?

246
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.240
Yutaka OIWA: we.

247
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:26.270
Yutaka OIWA: we are not how to say, not only these things that solve the problem. But we should face this all problems and

248
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:27.910
Yutaka OIWA: right.

249
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:38.450
Yutaka OIWA: how the proof of transit can solve that we need to develop more technology in the next step or something like that. So that's a straight model analysis.

250
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:44.039
Luigi Iannone: The same time, we don't need a specific document. Maybe we can also

251
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:48.990
Luigi Iannone: maybe include this type of analysis in the Service model document.

252
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:58.610
Yutaka OIWA: Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. If combined, it should be in the program statement document instead.

253
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:17.770
Antoine Fressancourt: Yeah, because, in fact, I'm not quite sure it's a full set model. But what I heard from the last buff is that we need to be clear, not overselling what Nasser, or whichever name will be in the future in the working group

254
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:21.080
Antoine Fressancourt: we are working on, because I think that

255
00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:43.609
Antoine Fressancourt: one major drawback that I saw from the name, and is that people had higher expectation about protections that would be out of the technology worked on another than what we agree on in this group would be the outcome of the of the work.

256
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.140
Antoine Fressancourt: So

257
00:38:45.180 --> 00:39:10.069
Antoine Fressancourt: is it a threat model? I think it's say, Okay, we are protecting against this attack against this kind of attacker and that. And that's it. We are not protecting the whole Internet against manipulation, of routing messages or or things like that. So it's it's really about positioning what NASA is doing with regards to how you

258
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:19.229
Antoine Fressancourt: and maintain secure routing and forwarding decision over limited domain and not on the Internet. And this kind of things.

259
00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.330
Nancy: Yeah, I I don't know that I would use secure.

260
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.810
Nancy: I use the word compliance.

261
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:33.309
Nancy: You're getting an attestation to a set of claims.

262
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:38.960
Nancy: The claim necessarily provide improved security.

263
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:45.260
Nancy: Right? You can it as yes, you can trust it right.

264
00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:59.629
Antoine Fressancourt: At least. Well, I I agree that security might not be the proper world, but at least you. The packet follows the pass. It's intended to follow.

265
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.740
Antoine Fressancourt: according to what you consider compliant with your requirements.

266
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:09.010
Nancy: Right.

267
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:29.869
Peter Liu: So I do agree. It's about compliance. It's about requirements and and compliance. But usually, but in this case our compliance is oriented to the security perspectives.

268
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:33.890
Peter Liu: So that may be part. That's a little bit tricky.

269
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:43.099
Peter Liu: So is this the does. The security means the routing security or the security, you know, attributes or security claims.

270
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.189
Luigi Iannone: Maybe for now we can just in the in, the in the

271
00:40:52.610 --> 00:41:04.515
Luigi Iannone: problem, statement, requirements will will include a threat analysis or and

272
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:09.069
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, then we will see how this evolve. But.

273
00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.130
Yutaka OIWA: So.

274
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:13.270
Luigi Iannone: What we need.

275
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.930
Luigi Iannone: We want to protect them. What we don't want or cannot.

276
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:30.420
Yutaka OIWA: So administrative question. So how important is how rigid is the list of work items. Is it

277
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:35.180
Yutaka OIWA: a binding? The number of documents we

278
00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:48.180
Yutaka OIWA: doing? And if, for example, if we need data, we need a program statement and state model are separated, we do we need the chartering? Or

279
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:54.280
Yutaka OIWA: we can just say, these 2 documents corresponding to this singular app item.

280
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.840
Nancy: Yeah.

281
00:41:56.093 --> 00:41:57.869
Luigi Iannone: The work. I Oh, go ahead, man.

282
00:41:58.196 --> 00:41:59.830
Nancy: Go ahead! Go ahead, Luigi.

283
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:08.490
Luigi Iannone: Usually the work items are translated in milestones associated with the charter, and that you agree on with your ad

284
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:18.639
Luigi Iannone: and the milestones can be changed if the ad agrees, and you don't need to. Recharge, however, doesn't, doesn't.

285
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.539
Luigi Iannone: doesn't mean that you cannot. Whatever document will you?

286
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.009
Luigi Iannone: As to be in the scope of the chart.

287
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:30.929
Yutaka OIWA: I see just middle of the hard end of the requirements, I see. Thank you.

288
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.530
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah. In that case.

289
00:42:38.251 --> 00:42:44.189
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah. In that case that can be included in the town, the problem to be solved

290
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:51.130
Yutaka OIWA: covering what we need to discuss at this moment. So we can start writing and

291
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.639
Yutaka OIWA: consider the foundation. If we need data.

292
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:07.490
Meiling Chen: Okay, I want back to Nancy's divorce compliance.

293
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:21.230
Meiling Chen: I think the compliance of users requirement is for security purpose. So why? Why do we think compliance is more proper than security.

294
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.000
Nancy: So to me security has connotations.

295
00:43:34.774 --> 00:43:43.839
Nancy: Which we cannot guarantee, so what could be secure to me is not necessarily secure to you.

296
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:47.960
Yutaka OIWA: They're.

297
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:57.990
Nancy: From a profile right? At which, unless you're gonna have a

298
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:08.609
Nancy: unless well, it depends on how we shape the work items here as well.

299
00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.220
Nancy: But

300
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:23.530
Nancy: To me the the definition of

301
00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:28.288
Nancy: I'm trying to remember the words that we used in the background.

302
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:38.209
Nancy: There's a set of attributes. Yes, and I think there would be some definition, maybe, of what the

303
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:50.700
Nancy: mandatory to implement claims are going to be right. The path attestation claim sets that go towards

304
00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:57.779
Nancy: that requirement. Now to me I question again.

305
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:06.149
Nancy: and one can argue, does that improve the security?

306
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.709
Nancy: Does that improve the level of trust?

307
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.180
Nancy: And to me.

308
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:21.099
Nancy: These attestations elevate the trust that you have. I don't know necessarily to me it's a subtle difference.

309
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:30.130
Nancy: but I it's a difference to me still that it. It elevates the trust, but not necessarily improves the security properties.

310
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.380
Yutaka OIWA: Well

311
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:46.710
Peter Liu: Well, part, you know, part of of purpose is to make, you know, to to to make discretions to, you know, separate the

312
00:45:47.020 --> 00:46:15.010
Peter Liu: so some devices with high security. You know, standards and some are have lower security standards, and by separating them and choosing only the the more secure, so so to speak, devices and and connect them into a path and a service. This is like this. This thing alone is to, you know, providing more security to the connectivity solution. If that makes sense.

313
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:23.969
Luigi Iannone: This is just a type of claim right? Because you can claim higher security another service can claim. I want

314
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.089
Luigi Iannone: network elements that are

315
00:46:26.648 --> 00:46:54.460
Luigi Iannone: located only in France, because I need to to share sensible data on the my flow. And by by law, I'm not allowed to send this type of data outside France. So the claim I may relax the the let's say, the device security level as a trade off to make sure that the the device is in located in France. So it's a different claim.

316
00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:01.870
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, but we have different claims. But we want a path that is compliant with our claims.

317
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:10.070
Luigi Iannone: So to me that the word compliance is okay.

318
00:47:11.672 --> 00:47:23.930
Yutaka OIWA: My comment is, compliance is very generic word, so as a faster use of the time at least, compliance to how to say requirements, or something like that.

319
00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:35.769
Yutaka OIWA: so not like a compliance to the laws, or something like that. So I understand the Nazis point in generally agreeing on that. But

320
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:40.599
Yutaka OIWA: phrasing need some a bit more.

321
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:50.820
Yutaka OIWA: How to say precise statement is needed. So maybe compliance to

322
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:55.099
Yutaka OIWA: what time we are using requirements, or something like that.

323
00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:01.200
Nancy: I didn't think we were using

324
00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:06.860
Nancy: security.

325
00:48:16.066 --> 00:48:27.450
Luigi Iannone: Do security right? We don't force any security technology mechanism whatever. We.

326
00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:37.009
Peter Liu: Not. We're not inventing some new security mechanism or anything. It's more like a visibility.

327
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.580
Peter Liu: But but it's still right.

328
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:46.510
Peter Liu: But the subject to visualize is about security perspectives. So this is why

329
00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:50.050
Peter Liu: it is a little bit tricky calm.

330
00:48:51.890 --> 00:49:01.839
Peter Liu: but all in all, I think in the end of the day the reason that we want to do this work is we want to provide more security and confidence

331
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.340
Peter Liu: to the connectivity service that we provide to the, to our customers.

332
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:10.779
Nancy: And and that's where the word trust is more appropriate.

333
00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:16.980
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, I was about to say the same thing. This is more about trustworthiness. I would say.

334
00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:17.500
Nancy: Right.

335
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.289
Peter Liu: Well, well, I I don't object to the word trust, but

336
00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:43.450
Peter Liu: I'm just trying to avoid the the mind. You know the subject. It might be 2 subjects to, to brand the word trust, but I personally like the word trust, but I don't want to make it too controversial, because everyone have different understandings of trust.

337
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:51.349
Peter Liu: but they could have very, you know, same understanding of security. We just, we just abstract them as security claims.

338
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:58.149
Nancy: Well, that's why my earlier comment was with the notion of trust.

339
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:04.860
Nancy: What you believe is trustworthy versus what I believe is trustworthy may be subtly different.

340
00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:13.000
Nancy: and that goes to the claim sets which I was calling a compliance profile.

341
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.900
Peter Liu: Hmm, well.

342
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:42.730
Peter Liu: yes. So so I think that's I think we are on the same page. So that. That's why I kind of use the word security, satisfying security, dash satisfying instead of you know, trust or or compliance. But eventually I think we we expecting the same thing.

343
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:51.699
Nancy: Okay. So coming back to the charter, because that's the most important.

344
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:53.850
Peter Liu: Is there wording.

345
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.830
Nancy: I'm I'm looking at the github right now. Thanks, Luigi.

346
00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:07.027
Michael Richardson: So I there was a pull request

347
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:13.720
Michael Richardson: And I made a couple of of of English comments.

348
00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:17.419
Michael Richardson: But you haven't merged that pull request into this text, so

349
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:22.620
Michael Richardson: not sure what you want to do. That was from who

350
00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.369
Michael Richardson: ggx, which is.

351
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.496
Luigi Iannone: That's me!

352
00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:32.140
Michael Richardson: There you go. Yeah,

353
00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:44.523
Michael Richardson: so I don't know if you want to just quickly merge that. Or if you want to discuss what what Luigi proposed. I don't have any problem with what is just. There was a couple of

354
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.290
Michael Richardson: word order issues.

355
00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:55.019
Michael Richardson: and I'm also concerned about the word remains elusive, which was in your new text, actually goes in the old text, too, isn't it?

356
00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:02.360
Michael Richardson: I think remains elusive. Makes it seem like we can't get there either.

357
00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.570
Nancy: Yeah, that would not. That would not be good.

358
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:14.390
Michael Richardson: Has been a challenge for others, or you know, we're anyway, it just been out of scope, for

359
00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:20.549
Michael Richardson: nobody's done the work because it's not because it's necessarily, you know, so impossible, but because it's not been in their mandate.

360
00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.420
Michael Richardson: There's no point doing the work. If no one's going to implement either.

361
00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.610
Nancy: That is correct.

362
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:32.699
Michael Richardson: And my impression is we have a critical mass of

363
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:38.500
Michael Richardson: implementers who want to write code and operators that wish to deploy it.

364
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:40.959
Michael Richardson: That's my impression is, we really do.

365
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:53.290
Luigi Iannone: This here, right.

366
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:57.150
Michael Richardson: Yeah. So you know, you can accept that suggestion.

367
00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:07.290
Michael Richardson: My, my add latency. I added latency to the list before.

368
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.399
Michael Richardson: I don't remember that I mean I do. But I don't remember it being here.

369
00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:17.499
Michael Richardson: No, this one was updated. Motivation number 5.

370
00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.260
Peter Liu: Think there's another pull request.

371
00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:28.610
Michael Richardson: Yeah. So that's already merged. So you've already done that updated motivation. Yeah, foreclosed. Don't go to closed. It's open.

372
00:53:29.042 --> 00:53:30.339
Luigi Iannone: The last one.

373
00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:30.680
Michael Richardson: Yeah.

374
00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.219
Luigi Iannone: I don't. Wanna.

375
00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:35.500
Michael Richardson: Yeah, Yeah, updated motivation yeah, yeah, yeah.

376
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.319
Luigi Iannone: Oh, I didn't. I see? Yeah.

377
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:48.010
Michael Richardson: See all I you just use the suggestion to change the text of not anymore. It was just, that's just awkward English. It's probably correct, but it's awkward.

378
00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.597
Luigi Iannone: oh, yeah, yeah, we can manage this. Actually,

379
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:05.130
Luigi Iannone: I can merge, this and then rework on the yeah, yeah.

380
00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:13.989
Nancy: If you merge it, Luigi, then I can work off, because, as I mentioned, I was doing my own rewrite.

381
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:23.640
Luigi Iannone: There are conflicts to be, we'll go over it and and merge it.

382
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:24.545
Yutaka OIWA: Okay.

383
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:31.030
Michael Richardson: Yeah, you could merge my suggestions without resolving it, and then you could resolve it.

384
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.870
Peter Liu: There's a.

385
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:39.319
Michael Richardson: Thing I suggest is, it's much easier. Forget if you always start new sentences on new lines

386
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.270
Michael Richardson: and you get smaller diffs.

387
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:48.550
Michael Richardson: Since Markdown wraps that all up for you, nobody else sees it. It just becomes a.

388
00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:51.510
Luigi Iannone: Okay. So I come.

389
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:53.690
Michael Richardson: Submit suggestion. Yeah, that's right.

390
00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.189
Michael Richardson: Then you can do the same to the other one. The other suggestion.

391
00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.390
Michael Richardson: Or you could have put them in a batch. But whatever doesn't really matter.

392
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.180
Michael Richardson: and you still have conflicts. So okay.

393
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:12.680
Yutaka OIWA: One.

394
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:44.060
Luigi Iannone: So it was a way to directly add the the conflicts right.

395
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.920
Peter Liu: I thought there used to be ways to resolve conflicts on the web page.

396
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.060
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, it is for the other one.

397
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.810
Luigi Iannone: I'm.

398
00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:55.940
Nancy: Never had luck. I've had to go.

399
00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:57.310
Nancy: Manual.

400
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.768
Yutaka OIWA: Use the command line.

401
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.968
Peter Liu: Maybe, Michael, do you? Do you have the

402
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:20.859
Peter Liu: Do you have the right to to to merge or pull request? Maybe

403
00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:27.439
Peter Liu: you can have to. You can help to resolve the conflict.

404
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:33.310
Michael Richardson: I I can go and resolve that conflict for you while we're you're talking. Yeah.

405
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:34.906
Luigi Iannone: Yes, please.

406
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:41.090
Yutaka OIWA: Maybe the base debasing is needed before margin.

407
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:48.839
Yutaka OIWA: What happens if you click the use the command line.

408
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:52.220
Yutaka OIWA: Bruticist.

409
00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:58.750
Yutaka OIWA: Okay.

410
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.781
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, I mean this, I know.

411
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:01.550
Yutaka OIWA: He's like.

412
00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:06.729
Luigi Iannone: It's usually what I do, but I wanted to do it on. Live just on the web page.

413
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.620
Peter Liu: Okay, I think Michael's fixed.

414
00:57:55.110 --> 00:58:01.610
Peter Liu: So while we wait, do, we have agreements on the work items

415
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.499
Peter Liu: currently listed in the in the charter.

416
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:22.960
Yutaka OIWA: Maybe we need some disc some, but I think that are good to set for the current moment.

417
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:29.419
Peter Liu: So we all agree. These are good proposed work items.

418
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:34.218
Yutaka OIWA: Prop at least good list for a proposed mailing list.

419
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.310
Peter Liu: Conflict is gone. Did you want me to merge that one.

420
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.550
Luigi Iannone: Yeah. Go ahead.

421
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:48.699
Michael Richardson: It looks like the the Git Command line. Merge did not have a conflict.

422
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:50.075
Yutaka OIWA: Oh!

423
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:50.840
Luigi Iannone: It.

424
00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:54.490
Michael Richardson: I just. Github doesn't always know

425
00:58:54.710 --> 00:59:00.390
Michael Richardson: it doesn't use all of the merge mechanism methods all the time.

426
00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.060
Luigi Iannone: So here we go.

427
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.580
Michael Richardson: So it's merged. If you hit reload, it should.

428
00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:07.840
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, we have it with the customer. Right?

429
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.939
Peter Liu: Yeah, I think it's first.st

430
00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:13.690
Luigi Iannone: No.

431
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:15.820
Michael Richardson: Customers with high security. There you go!

432
00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.310
Luigi Iannone: Yeah.

433
00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.150
Peter Liu: Right.

434
00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:29.940
Luigi Iannone: So this part will be a little bit reworked as discussed to avoid customer network deployments and

435
00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:35.159
Luigi Iannone: our operators as we discussed.

436
00:59:36.052 --> 00:59:47.180
Luigi Iannone: This. Maybe, we said, put it at the end work items. Since they we agree, we may need to. We will drop this section. The paragraph, sorry.

437
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:54.610
Luigi Iannone: and maybe we have to revise a little bit. This I didn't go through that this part.

438
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:06.560
Luigi Iannone: yeah, I can revise it and and propose revised text.

439
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:14.300
Luigi Iannone: so that that we agree on by early next week at latest.

440
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:16.570
Luigi Iannone: Yeah.

441
01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:21.395
Luigi Iannone: So we'll send it most probably tomorrow and

442
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:34.969
Luigi Iannone: the few minutes left, unless you. You still have anything you want to share on on the chat that we can have a quick go on the naming.

443
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:42.329
Luigi Iannone: so I gather it. I listed everything that is being mentioned, but the most

444
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:51.209
Luigi Iannone: the the ones that oops that were more prefer. That would say, I want to keep NASA,

445
01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:56.579
Luigi Iannone: or to shift to Felpa, as proposed by Diego.

446
01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:57.850
Michael Richardson: I think.

447
01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:05.800
Luigi Iannone: The latest email were were about, keeping the the acronym so that we show that we have worked.

448
01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.580
Luigi Iannone: We didn't change the proposal. We worked to improve the proposal.

449
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.129
Luigi Iannone: That's my reading on the mailing list.

450
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:24.349
Michael Richardson: I suggested at some point that was widely agreed some months ago that we would prefer to have secured routing or forwarding rather than secure.

451
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.439
Michael Richardson: but I don't know if that was.

452
01:01:27.391 --> 01:01:29.599
Luigi Iannone: So we have forwarding here.

453
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:39.780
Michael Richardson: Yeah. Well, this, I think, before we even got to forwarding versus route routing, I thought we we were going to change it from secure to secured.

454
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.280
Luigi Iannone: Oh! Secure!

455
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:42.810
Peter Liu: Of course.

456
01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:43.590
Michael Richardson: Yeah.

457
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.329
Peter Liu: Just put a d on the end.

458
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:46.060
Michael Richardson: But indeed.

459
01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:54.130
Michael Richardson: in there I think it. It works better, probably with all of the different proposals, unless you go to verifiable or dependable.

460
01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:55.260
Michael Richardson: or whatever.

461
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.100
Luigi Iannone: Well, I did it. Do.

462
01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:04.489
Michael Richardson: Luigi, can you say? Can you say the word, Felpa for us with your with a good good, you know accent.

463
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:11.650
Yutaka OIWA: I don't have the good accent, because I'm Italian, and Diego is Spanish, so.

464
01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:15.229
Michael Richardson: Say it was a good Mediterranean accent, you know, like, you know.

465
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:21.680
Luigi Iannone: In Italy we have that word which is Pelpa, and that means sweatshirt.

466
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.005
Michael Richardson: Sweatshirt.

467
01:02:25.536 --> 01:02:27.760
Nancy: In Spanish means, felt.

468
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.550
Peter Liu: It's very different.

469
01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:33.619
Luigi Iannone: It's exhaust exactly the same stuff.

470
01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:37.420
Michael Richardson: Routing protocol that you can wear while you're working out.

471
01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.510
Luigi Iannone: So should we go for this.

472
01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.135
Yutaka OIWA: I personally prefer favorite.

473
01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:50.359
Yutaka OIWA: I don't argue strongly.

474
01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:01.706
Nancy: I mean, we can use the terms that effectively. What we're doing is we're providing evidence for forwarding. But

475
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.380
Yutaka OIWA: Hmm.

476
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:08.470
Luigi Iannone: There was my proposal at the beginning, like accountable or.

477
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:09.680
Peter Liu: Sounds, like.

478
01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:19.880
Luigi Iannone: Like like that, we can still have the nasser acronym by playing with the letters that we use. I mean at the end, if you wish that this word here.

479
01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.359
Peter Liu: So accountable.

480
01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.230
Luigi Iannone: Changeable.

481
01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.340
Peter Liu: I mean accountable is another word that could lead to confusion.

482
01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.180
Luigi Iannone: Yeah,

483
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:38.300
Nancy: I think secured. Forwarding is fine.

484
01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:48.150
Michael Richardson: And and you know we could also, just in the whole thing we could let the Isg, you know.

485
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:49.789
Michael Richardson: do the bike shedding.

486
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:59.640
Luigi Iannone: Yeah, okay, let's let's just because we let's settle for this with secured.

487
01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:00.870
Michael Richardson: Okay.

488
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:01.580
Peter Liu: I?

489
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.499
Peter Liu: Yeah, I mean, do, is there? Is I so sorry? I don't know like in the past, Buffs, do they

490
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:13.950
Peter Liu: do this kind of poll, of naming on the on the spot.

491
01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.420
Michael Richardson: Sure. Yeah.

492
01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:17.070
Peter Liu: They do that.

493
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:21.640
Michael Richardson: Yeah. And then they take it as as input. To the Isg to

494
01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.820
Michael Richardson: who will make the decision anyway?

495
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:31.830
Peter Liu: Oh, can we just produce candidates, final candidates of Poll.

496
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:43.900
Michael Richardson: And and occasionally, you know, someone at the Isg level comes back and says, Oh, wait! In this particular language. It's an extremely rude word. Oh, all right, you know. Nobody knew right.

497
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.139
Nancy: This is why, sticking to Nasser, we don't have to go through the whole pain again.

498
01:04:50.925 --> 01:04:56.409
Nancy: Given that. We only have 2 min left. I was going to ask the question.

499
01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:01.720
Nancy: because last time, although I don't see a whole lot of people on this call, either.

500
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:08.689
Nancy: I'm okay. Keeping this time 7 Am. Pacific for me.

501
01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:15.299
Nancy: cause I think, Luigi, our next call was, gonna Be very early for you.

502
01:05:15.844 --> 01:05:19.110
Luigi Iannone: Yes, that's the the next one.

503
01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.240
Nancy: Yeah, 20, second, right?

504
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.609
Luigi Iannone: So let me put full screen so that it's more readable.

505
01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.888
Luigi Iannone: So parties is 5 o'clock in the morning.

506
01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:37.170
Luigi Iannone: Beijing in Tokyo is middle of the day for you is evening.

507
01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.320
Nancy: Right.

508
01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.919
Nancy: I was just gonna ask a question because

509
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:48.470
Nancy: there were a couple of people that complained the last time.

510
01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:59.620
Luigi Iannone: Oh, well, I don't have any preference. It's it's it's

511
01:06:02.144 --> 01:06:05.480
Luigi Iannone: I found fair that we

512
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:10.320
Luigi Iannone: we change the time so that we share the day in a certain way.

513
01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.189
Luigi Iannone: just keep it as it is.

514
01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.320
Yutaka OIWA: Just for information. Iso has very strict rule for

515
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:24.500
Yutaka OIWA: time, slot every 8 h, separated in 3 slots like

516
01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:32.310
Yutaka OIWA: somewhere in early morning, but not to the night time in East Asia and Europe and

517
01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:34.530
Yutaka OIWA: San Francisco. Somewhere.

518
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:40.769
Nancy: So we we can stick to this. I just have to remember. It's the day before for me.

519
01:06:41.778 --> 01:06:50.931
Yutaka OIWA: Okay. So for me, it's 1 8. Now one am. So I have to leave now. But.

520
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:58.479
Nancy: So you, Ted. This is why we we did. This alternate time was to make it easier for

521
01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.900
Nancy: for Asia.

522
01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:01.110
Yutaka OIWA: Yeah.

523
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:05.675
Yutaka OIWA: For me. It's okay. But yeah.

524
01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:09.709
Nancy: So we we

525
01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:15.230
Nancy: oh, yeah, we didn't want to make it too much later, because of the people on the East Coast.

526
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:21.290
Nancy: Michael, I don't know how late cause you're in Canada.

527
01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:22.610
Nancy: Ottawa.

528
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:40.065
Michael Richardson: Yeah, I'm in the New York New York equivalent time zone. So yeah, you know, if you made it later, I would, I would. It wouldn't be any different. Staying up to 11 to midnight is the same as midnight to one. You gotta stay up and need coffee, and you might need a disco nap, and whatever.

529
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:48.640
Nancy: I yeah, I was gonna say for the Europeans. I don't know if if shifting it to 1 h later. But

530
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:56.740
Nancy: I'm fine keeping it, Luigi. I just I know. Last time we had the call late. People complained.

531
01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:00.869
Nancy: I don't remember. I just remember it was the people in Europe.

532
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:02.740
Luigi Iannone: Oh,

533
01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:10.689
Luigi Iannone: Since at the very 1st meeting that we had back in in November.

534
01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:31.260
Luigi Iannone: There was some some form of confusion about the hours, the day, etcetera, as well. I would keep the schedule as it is to avoid that someone comes up with. Oh, I thought, is the other hour, because I noted already my calendar or something like that. I would keep it. But it's just my opinion. I mean, it's.

535
01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:37.349
Nancy: Yep, no, this is. This is fine. Then I just wanted to to make sure.

536
01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:43.399
Nancy: at least with those that are on the call right now that it's fine. So

537
01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:48.749
Nancy: okay, with that, I do have to go to my next call.

538
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.760
Nancy: But I think.

539
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.340
Luigi Iannone: Okay.

540
01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:55.350
Nancy: We're converging, which is good.

541
01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:04.009
Peter Liu: Sorry. Just we. We are using this this same time, or we are keeping the original meeting schedule on the Github.

542
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:06.710
Luigi Iannone: Dude.

543
01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.479
Michael Richardson: Time is what I heard, not changing.

544
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.990
Yutaka OIWA: Not the same thing right?

545
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:15.460
Nancy: Not changing. It's whatever we posted on the Github.

546
01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:19.750
Nancy: Okay? Okay? Meaning the. It'll be.

547
01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:24.550
Yutaka OIWA: For for 4 am. Utc.

548
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.090
Nancy: Correct.
